What you need to know if you're new to this sort of thing:

-1) Use this at your own risk. There is no malicous code in FL source code, no backdoors etc.

0) This tarball includes everything from ForsakenLands except its areas and various morps.

1) 
./src/ is the source file directory.  The makefile present there allows you to just type in "make" or "make all"
to compile the code.

2) The executable file is "clands" (the original name for ForsakenLands was CursedLands, however most domain 
names for that were taken, thus it became ForsakenLands we all know and love today.  The executable file
stayed as clands beacuse I'm sentimental :)  )

3) You can start the mud using ".startup" script file in the ./area/ directory.  Just enter ".startup" while
in the directory.  Edit the script file to put in your prefered port.

4) There is a single level 60 pfile included with name "Admin".  Use that to get yourself started.

5) If you activly play FL, please do not mention anything you learned from this source code on its Forums.
We've always respected everyone's right to learn their own advanced info.  Please keep it that way.

6) These files are presented as-is.  Please do not contanct me for help or explanations, comments etc.

7) Enjoy.
