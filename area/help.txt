-1 TRAPS +~
TRAPS
( for description of thief trap skill use "help thief traps")

  Due to the guild of Thieves natural willingness to lend their services
to anyone with enough gold, the land of Aabahran has become riddled with
various devices and traps ranging from harmless to deviously deadly in their
construction and placement.

SEEING BEFORE DYING
 A trap may be present on any object, or path or door leading from a room, and
when spotted is represented by `!+`` appearing beside an object, or exit.
An exit can further be examined or looked at using "examine" or "look".

Your chances to spot a trap before setting it off are mainly decided by
wisdom, and more reliably by the proficiency in Detect Hidden skill.
Thieves being quite used to these devices get a bonus towards detection.

DEFUSING
 An object or exit may be checked for traps and defused if one is found
using the "defuse" command.  If successful the trap will be disarmed and
destroyed if it was created by another player.

PLAYER TRAPS
  Most of the traps in the Lands, have been created by the Thief Guild and
are maintained by them.  Those traps cannot be removed, and will be rearmed
and reset once every so often by the guild.

 The traps set and created by individual players however, once disarmed or
tripped, are usually removed.  These traps also obey PK ranges and cannot be
seen, defused, or tripped by those outside of their owner's PK range.

-1 DEFUSE~
DEFUSE
Syntax:	defuse <obj>		: attempts to defuse a trap on object
	defuse <direction>	; attempts to defuse a trap on path or door

  Since the guild of Thieves delights in lending its services out to anyone
with enough gold to pay for their traps, the land of Aabahran is riddled
with such devices.  When the trap is spotted, you may attempt to defuse it
using this command with your rank and wisdom playing a large role.
Those actually skilled in defusing traps, have a far better chance of spotting
and defusing the deadly contraptions then their unskilled bretheren.

#4
-1 SHEATH DRAW~
SHEATH
Syntax: sheath		: sheathes your weapons if possible
	draw		: draws your weapons if possible

  Any profession of Forsaken Lands has ability to sheath their
weapons.  When sheathed the weapons are placed in sheathes or 
other, at times hidden positions depending on one's guild.  
Sheathed weapons will be drawn automaticly in an event of combat, 
or by choice with use of 'draw' command.

  Sheathing of weapons is a sign of good intentions, and in case
of any Noble or Royal dwellings etiquette.  The JUSTICE cabal also
requires that all weapons be sheathed in cities under their watch,
with promise of heavy fines otherwise.

 Finaly, while your weapons are sheathed, you will not automaticly 
engage in combat when your group does, nor will you be able to 'murder' 
anyone.  Weapons may be sheathed and drawn automaticly in cities with
use of 'autosheath'.

SOCKETS

Syntax: GET <SOCKET> FROM <ITEM>
        PUT <SOCKET> IN <ITEM>

There are certain items within the realms that are considered to be
'socketable' items. This basically means that a small clasp has been
forged in a weapon or piece of armor to which a 'socket' can be affixed.
Sockets range from gemstones to spikes, and can be found all over the
realms in varying locations. Certain sockets can only fit in certain
items, and grant that item the properties of that socket. There are also
certain sockets that once affixed, can never be removed.

-1 'SKILL SELECT' SELECT~
SKILL SELECT

ON SKILL SELECTION:
  Number of classes and races in Forsaken Lands offer opportunity for the player
to customise their class through selection of skills as the character progresses
through the levels.  Many of the skills are linked in a "research tree" fashion
where choices you make early on drasticly affect skills avaliable to you at 
later time.  The skill selection is offered at specific levels marked on the "skill" 
sheet by the names of a group of skills from which selections may be made.  To 
enter the skill selection mode once a group of skill is avaliable to  you use 
"select" command.

-1 'CABAL RULES'~
THE CARDINAL RULES OF CABAL CONDUCT

Welcome to your new Cabal. Before you proceed, it is imperative that you
read and understand this list of dos and donts for your cabal. This IS the
final word for all cabal affairs in the lands.

The following is a compiled list of rules and regulations regarding all cabal
conduct in Aabahran. This list applies to ALL CABALS, without exception, and
should be adhered to closely. Failure to follow any of these rules can and
will result in termination of cabal status.

GENERAL:

1) Cabal members are the selected elite of the land. You have worked hard on
your character, and have been admitted into the cabal of your choice. You are
now a rolemodel of behavior for all lower players in the lands, and your
conduct in the lands should reflect accordingly. ALL cabal members are expect-
ed to have flawless roleplay. AT NO TIME will ANY cabal member breach their
RP for ANY reason, other than speaking with an Immortal. There are not ANY
exceptions to this cardinal rule.

2) You are a part of an organization. Like any organization, your status in
the cabal depends on your actions within. You may be terminated from the cabal
for any reason, and any time by your cabal elders. A reason does not have to
be given, but some of the reasons for this occurrence may be: Breach of RP,
failure to carry out specific cabal duties, failure to uphold the values set
forth by your cabal, failure to appear on a regular basis, among others.

LEADERSHIP:

1) Your cabal may have a designated Elder or Leader. These mortals have worked
very hard to attain their cabal status, and should be given due regard. Their
orders and words are to be taken as the voice of an Immortal. As well, all cabals
are governed by an immortal. This Immortal is the absolute power within the
cabal. Any orders given by the leader or patron are to be adhered to. Failure 
to do so, or extended disrespect to Elders or Leaders can result in
termination.

CONFIDENTIALITY:

1) You may not share any written or spoken words that dictate the effects,
lists, or abilities of ANY cabal, to ANY non-cabal member. Cabal skills are
highly coveted abilities, and should ONLY be shared between cabal members.
Likewise, you may not tell of, give, sell, or trade ANY cabal equipment or
items with anyone not of your own cabal. There is more information on this
in the RULES OF ENGAGEMENT section. Any breach of these will result in 
termination.

CABAL POINTS:

1) Cabal points are the currency your cabal uses to fuels you special powers, 
purchase equipment and supplies. The are give automatically on each tick, 
(type: auto), as well given out for cabal duties.


CABAL STANDARD

1)  Your cabal standard represents the source of your pride and power of your
cabal.  Ensuring that it remains within the confines of your altar is a duty
who's priority lies above all other tasks you may have.  Ignoring attacks
on your cabal guardian or altar will result in explusion from the cabal.

SUMMARY:

This is a GENERAL list of cabal behavior, which will apply to ALL CABALS. Certain
cabals may as well have extended rules of conduct, and you should familiarize your-
self with them as well. On a last note, remember, character alignment and ethos
supercede a cabal affiliation. This means that the rules of your alignment and your
ethos must be followed BEFORE following the rules of the cabal. Keep this, and all 
cabal rules in mind. 
~

#13
-1 ALIGN ALIGNMENT ETHOS~
ALIGN ALIGNMENT ETHOS

One's alignment is the path that one has chosen to follow: good, neutral,
or evil.  It reflects one's nature, and describes how he reacts to
situations and how he interacts with others.  Ethos farther refines how
one upholds his alignment.  Alignment and ethos are chosen at birth, and
the gods expect mortals to follow their chosen paths for their entire
lives.

The most important rule of alignment is that a follower of Light can
NEVER kill another follower of Light.  This is a cardinal rule of aligns
and its violation will result in align change or outcasting.

Mortals who fail their alignment or ethos will be punished by the gods.
Those who have their alignment and/or ethos changed may be punished
additionally by losing some or all of their skills and/or spells.

Actions deemed unacceptable by one's guild, such as attack one's own
guild guardian, will warrant being outcasted from the guild.

~

#14
51 ALIGN ALIGNMENT ETHOS~
NOTE ON ALIGN CHANGES:
  
  When a character changes his align he keeps his spell casting powers.
However, when a communer (uses "commune" command to cast) has has his
align changed in such way that the new align conflicts with his deity
(a good only deity for an evil mortal) the mortal HAS to be denied his
magical powers using "set <char> nospells" command.
~

#15
-1 GOOD~
GOOD

Goods consider the need of others in tandem with their own.  Many good-
aligns will place the well-being of others above that of themselves.
A few have been known to shun violence and war altogether, but most
Lightwalkers will fight against evil when necessary, in order to
protect themselves and others.  Goods who are overly bloodthirsty
against neutrals will be reprimanded, and raising one's hand against
a fellow Lightwalker is a sure way to incite the anger of the gods.

Of all classes, paladins clerics, and healers are the ones most expect to 
uphold those ideals.

~

#16
-1 NEUTRAL~
NEUTRAL

Neutrals derive their name from the fact that their behavior is marked by
neither philanthropy nor malice, or perhaps both in equal proportions.
Although some may choose to engage in violence as part of their chosen
profession, no one who is truly neutral would have the callous disregard
for others to murder without a clear justification for the killing.
Neutrals who kill excessively without reason, or for reasons considered
purely selfish or malicious, will be turned to the path of Darkness.

Because they are servants of neither the Gods of Light or the Gods of
Darkness, neutrals are more free from bias in their adherence to their
ethos.

See Also: HELP LAWFUL NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL NEUTRAL, CHAOTIC NEUTRAL
~

#17
-1 EVIL~
EVIL

Heedless of the well-being of others, evils selfishly and shamelessly
live to exploit others for their own advancement and power.  Some who
are truly wicked even venture forth to spread suffering unto others
for their own amusement, or in service to their merciless gods.  Evils
will lend aid to others only in proportion to what is received in
return, for the helping of others in growing stronger weakens oneself
in comparison.  No matter how much they attempt to manipulate or control 
others, true evils strive to become powerful in their own right and shun 
displaying or admitting weakness, for this only invites aggression from 
their brethren.

Of all classes, dark-knights, clerics and shamans are the ones most 
expected to uphold these ideals.

#18
-1 PRAY YELL~
PRAY YELL
Syntax: pray     <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

PRAY sends a message to the gods.  However, use caution.  The Gods are 
not to be trifled with, and can often be very unhappy if pointlessly
disturbed.

YELL sends a message to all those awake within your area.

-1 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP USE~
BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP USE
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap
Syntax: use	 <object>

USE automaticly brandishes/zaps/uses magical items.

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff to cast a spell (affects a whole
group/area)

QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane
liquids).

RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the
nature of the scroll.

ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you
are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

Most of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a
single charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical
object has no more charges, it will be destroyed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help
entries on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.

You may not quaff potions or recite scrolls while in combat.

#21
-1 BRIEF COMPACT~
BRIEF COMPACT
Syntax: brief
Syntax: compact

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game.  Typing brief

#22
-1 AVATAR AVATARS~
AVATAR AVATARS

Avatars are creatures of the light, who fight the evil who engulf
the lands.  They are the most elite of those who fight for the
Light. Avatars are messengers of Sirant, and are avenging angels
of sorts. They are created to battle Chaos with divinity, and are
the chosen emissaries of the God of Light himself. Granted with
their path come several strong abilities and enhancements that
grant them great strength over Demons, and other Darkwalkers.

If you are truly divine in nature, and feel you exemplify the
true virtues of the light, scribe a well written application to
Sirant stating your history and which events shaped your life
to motivate you. Brave souls of any rank are welcome to apply, so
long as they believe their presence in the lands is worthy of
this highest honor.

~

#25
-1 CAST CASTING~
CAST
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs
mana.  The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frog
Quoting is optional for single-word spells.  You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.  Casting an offensive spell on yourself will
result in memory impairment for you to cast that spell in the future lowering
your skill in the spell.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

#26
-1 COMMUNE~
COMMUNE
Syntax: commune <supplication> <target>

There are certain classes in the realm which dedicate their lives in the
service of god(s).  As a reward, the deities have granted the faithful a
special ability called Commune.  This privilege allows the communer to
channel power directly from the heaven or nether-realms and use them to
their ends.  Since they are mentally communicating with the gods, they
have no need to utter words like mages to invoke their power.

As with all skills, one must first practice the supplication before one is
able to communicate with the god effectively.  The more one communes a
particular supplication, the better they will become at it.  Due to its
mental strain, communing supplications depletes your mana, however, as you
raise in rank most supplications will not be as taxing on the mind.

Paladins, Clerics, Healers, and Shamans are able to commune.
See also the help sections for individual supplications.
~

#27
-1 CB~
CB

The CB toggle turns off your cabal channel (if you are in a cabal).  You will
not be able to hear what your cabalmates say over the channel if you set the
channel off.  You can type it again to toggle the channel on so you can
communicate with your cabalmates through the channel once again.
~

#28
-1 COMPARE~
COMPARE

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

#29
-1 CONSIDER~
CONSIDER
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.  Of course,
it's only a rough estimate.  Factors such as special effects, immunities, and
vulnerabilities are not taken into account.  You may also find out the 
alignment of the character by their reaction to you.

Depending on the reaction from the CONSIDERED target, you can tell of
which alignment they are.
~

#30

COUNT

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.

powerful hit, damage is key.  Here is the damage you can cause ranked from 
lightest to hardest (descending in each column).

scratch		maul		LACERATE	*** OBLITERATE ***
graze		decimate	DISMEMBER	=== DISINTEGRATE ===
hit 		devastate	MASSACRE	>>> ANNIHILATE <<<

wound 		MUTILATE	***DEMOLISH*** 	do UNSPEAKABLE things 
~

#32
-1 DEAF~
DEAF

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply')
to reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a (it's mostly
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

#33
-1 DEATH~
DEATH

DEATH
  When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the recall point
of your hometown.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were
killed, together with all of your equipment and gold.  Corpses decay
after time, and the objects inside the corpse returns to the pit of the
hometown of the dead.  Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game
time (15 minutes of real time).

LOOTING CORPSES
  There are following conditions for looting corpses in order to make the
game more enjoyable for every one:

1) Players cannot loot other's corpses until they have reached the rank of 10.
2) PC corpses under level 15 cannot be looted at all.
3) In first 2 hours after death, your corpse can be looted only by following:
	- Your group mates
	- People who are in your PK range. ("who pk")
	- Members of Thief guild.

Note that if you quit before retrieving your corpse, the corpse will no
longer recognize you and some of the above may not hold.  

LIFE AFTER DEATH
  After the reincarnation, you will remain an untouchable ghost for a few
minutes (as long as you don't initiate a combat).  It is wise for you to
use this time to retrieve your belongings left behind in your corpse.
So get back to your corpse as fast as you can to retrieve your
belongings.

EFFECTS OF DEATH
  Although you are able to reincarnate and live again after a short time
as a ghost, this reincarnation process is not perfect.  Some of your 
health is lost for every five times you die.  Your body can only withstand
so much reincarnation.  You will permanently die without a chance of
reincarnation after your condition worsens after too many deaths.  If you
have lived an outstanding life, you may prove your worthiness to the
Immortals by completing a quest to improve your condition when in danger
of permanent death.

- Any spells that were affecting you are canceled by death.
- Following players and groups are not affected by death.

PRICE OF DEMISE
  You lose experience points for dying to mobiles but not to other
players.  The amount you lose is 10% of your total experience.  Death is
to be avoided.  The Healer spell Resurrection has ability to negate all
effects of death including experience and condition as well as constitution
loss.
~

#34
-1 DEFECATE~
DEFECATE
Syntax: defecate

An optional command, one can excrete their bodily waste once every day.
This is extremely useful when you are too full to eat more, but need
to pop in a pill, etc.  Once used, you cannot defecate until a day has
passed.  Keep in mind however, that it is against the law to desecrate
city grounds.
~

#35
-1 VOMIT~
VOMIT
Syntax: vomit
  An optional command used to empty your stomach of anything you had in there.
It has slight chance of puring one of any poisons that are affecting you at
the time, even though the relative strength of the poison does play a large
role.
~

#36
-1 DESCRIPTION DESC~
DESCRIPTION DESC
Syntax: description   <string>	:Set description to <string>
Syntax: description + <string>	:Add <string> as a new line.
Syntax: description -		:Remove last line
Syntax: description format	:Format the description.
Syntax: description edit	:Enter Desc. Editor.
** "@" <enter> on empty line of Desc. Editor to exit. **

See HELP EDITOR for info on Description Editor.

1)  `!YOUR DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE FORMATTED TO AT MOST 70 LETTERS PER LINE.``
Use word processor to write/format/spell check your description, then paste
it into the mud's description editor. ("help editor")
 
2)  `&Your description should be like a picture frozen in time.``
There should be no actions being performed, only descriptions of what
the character looks like, or looks like he is doing.
 
3)  `&You should NEVER force the looker to do, feel or think anything.``
The looker should make up their own minds about who you are, and what
you might be doing.
 
4)  `&The description should describe you, not your history.``
Concentrate on describing your characters stance, face, body, and their
equipment.  Not who they are, and where they came from.
 
5)  `&Do NOT say how powerful, fearful, or deadly you are.``
The description is not the place to "stroke your ego" by saying how
powerful you are and how fearful you look.  
 
6)  You may include descriptions of equipment that you would like your
character to wear (family crested shields, particular sword etc.) since
it is understood that the actual game equipment changes too often.
When you are done your description and it has been `!formatted`` and 
`!spell checked`` pray ONCE per approximately 10 minutes that you are 
done.

-1 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP

Your character may advance in power by gaining experience.  The experience
points needed to attain your next level is determined by your experience
points per level at level 1 + 20% for each level. Therefore, a human warrior
(1500 experience points per level at level 1) would need 3000 experience
points to get from level 6 to level 7.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster
    improving on a skill or a spell

You lose experience by:

    slaying good aligned mobiles if you are also good aligned
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying to mobiles

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your
alignment versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been
killed lately; and some random variation.

There is a big experience bonus for groups of three and a small bonus for
groups of two.

battle.

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep fighting,
and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances of making the
recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

High ranked warriors are able to sense the direction they have fled in.

-1 HEALER~
There are many retired healers and priests in the realm who have long since
abandoned their days of adventuring.  Now, they often reside in temples to

-1 TOUR~
TOUR
 
As a new traveler to the land, you have dreams of growing stronger, but
chances are you do not know where you begin.  What follows is directions to
get you started on your way.  
 
Upon your birth into these lands, you are provided with maps.  These maps
are a great asset to you in your travels, make sure to consult them often
and try to learn the general layout of the land (If you loose them for any
reason you can "outfit" (Help Outfit) yourself if you are still low of rank,
or purchase them in Val Miran map shop.)  .  When you begin, it is suggested
you gain 3 or so ranks inside the mud school and equip yourself with the
things found there.  Remeber to set your "wimpy" (Help Wimpy) very high in
your early life, and get a feel for attacking and fleeing monsters found
there in.  Also venture to the sacrifical pits of various temples, you never
know what equipment lies inside (Corpses of fallen players decompose after
about 15 minutes and their equipment appears in the pit of their home
temple). 
 
Soon you will feel that combat in mud school is too easy and begin to
yearn for more things to see.  Once you exit the mud school, you have a
choice of cities to exit to, Val Miran, Rheydin, Miruvhor, Marak, or
Xymmeria.  It is recommended that you limit yourself to Val Miran, Rheydin,
and Miruvhor until you are more familiar with the lands.  Entrances back to
the school are found in every temple room that holds a pit, simply walk down
when you see the path.  Before you set out onto your first venture, visit
the weapon/armor shops of Rheydin (Consult your maps of Rheydin, shops are
marked with an X) and attempt to outfit yourself with weapons and armor
found there.  All of them are worthy of the gold you spent on them and will
serve you well.  While there find the Adventurer's Store (located two paces
east and one pace south of the Central Commons) and once able, purchase a
jug and a lantern as to not get lost later on in your life (You will not be
harmed by thirst and hunger untill your 11th rank, but it will still slow
your regeneration.)  .  Once so eqipped you are ready to tackle your first
foes.

The most important concept in adventuring is that of groups.  Forsaken
Lands stresses group effort by giving adventurers a sizable bonus to
experience (Help Experience) gained from killing mobs.  This bonus is
applied to groups of 2, and even larger bonus is given to groups of 3.  This
means that you should attmempt to adventure in groups of 3 if possible at
all times (use "who group" command to see your possible group mates). 
Furthermore evil charactes learn more when killing good creatures, and goods
learn more when killing evils.  When engaging mobs, it is customary to let
the most defensible character be a "tank".  A tank, is simply a character
who initiates attacks onto the creatures, automaticly becoming their target
and absorbing all the attacks (Notice many creatures will assist each other
in trouble, making it hazardous to attack when there is more then one in the
room.)  .  Obviously warrior like characters make the best tanks, while
mages are usually quickly cut down due to their poor defenses.  What follows
is a few hints as to the locations you should choose in your early life.  
 
Evil/Neutral Characters: 
 
When you are fresh out of mud school and of
neutral or evil align, it is suggested you find the raiders that wander just
south of the evil city of Miruvhor, and the goblin village to the east of
them.  There is a secret door you may find in southern portion of the city
that leads into a village.  It is a perfect place to gain next few ranks, as
well as find lots of usefull equipment.  Simply tread lightly and use the
"consider" command (Help Consider) on any creatures you are unfamiliar with.
 
For travellers who are neutral aligned, after you have gained a few more
ranks (achieved rank 5-7), journey to Drkshtyre Wood, just out of the south
gates of Val Miran and kill a few spiders and oozes to gain the next few
ranks, or if you are about rank eight, venture to the Emerald Forest (See
below).  You can get to Val Miran by using the portals in the cities. 
Venture back to Miruvhor and look for the Gate Golem.  This will take you to
the town of Rheydin.  Once there, seek the Val Miran portal.  For those who
are evil, you will not want to kill evil creatures (use "consider" once
again to judge the creature's alignment) hence most other creatures in
Drkshtyre will be of little use to you.  Once you are about level eight and
feel up to a bit of harder challange travel to the Emerald Forest (consult
your maps again, it is located south west of Miruvhor) and hunt farmers and
other weaker creatures there (beware of the boogum near the entrance!)  The
Emerald forest is a great place to take you all the way into upper levels,
even if it is a very crowded and dangerous place.  
 
Once you have gained ranks into the early teens, you may want to visit
the Orc Mountains, through the Dragon Teeth to find more suitable wares. 
The mountains lie east of Rheydin, and north of the road.  There are orc
scouts and warriors that guard the trails, and travellers wander enjoying
the sights.  Use caution while here though, as the foes can be formidable. 
It is wise to "consider" things when you first come across them.  Once done
collecting the wares from the orcs, return to the Emerald Forest to continue
your travels.

Good/Neutral Characters:
  
If you are a lightwalker or walk the balance, Elium forest is a good
place to start adventuring if you feel the Arena is no longer challenging
enough.  Head out of the northern gate of Val Miran to find the forest.  In
there you will find outlaws camped to the east.  Not only will they help you
in gaining ranks, but they carry wares that will be helpful in your early
travels.  This is the ideal place for you to adventure until you are around
rank five, then you should seek the lamias that plague the ruined city of
Thalos.  Beware the aggressive nature of the beasts though, as they will
attack any on sight, so you may wish your warriors to enter the fray first. 
When you consult your maps, you will see that Thalos lies east of Val Miran
and south of the road into the Dwarf Forest.  Once in the forest, head west
to find the city.  You can stay in Thalos for a short while, then once you
have gained about the eighth rank, head back to Val Miran and travel out the
south gate, you will find yourself in Drkshtyre Wood.  When in Drkshtyre
Wood, those of path of good will want to stay clear of the saplings, and
focus on the oozes and spiders.  Later you can seek the serpents in the
northwest of the woods, and the Ettins and Defilers in the west.  The forest
is easly capable of sustaining you until you reach a rank of 12-15 when you
will be ready to tackle tougher creatures such as the Vampires to the west
of Val Miran.  To find them, travel out of the west gate to the great tree. 
There is a door to the west, open it and you will enter the lair of the vile
undead.  Once you have gained ranks into the high teens, return to Thalos
and find the golems that guard the towers.  They hold wares that will guard
you well in your travels.  Those who follow the path of the light will have
to request the items from them or be damned by the gods if taken by force
(Help Request).  For those who walk the balance, you will have to take them
by force, but do not be grouped with lightwalkers when you do, as the gods
will still punish them for attacking and slaying fellow lightwalkers.  After
you are equipped with these wares you can return to the lair of the vampires
to continue with your journeys. 
 
While your first days in the Forsaken Lands might seem very daunting
remember that the best way to quickly get on your feet and begin enjoying
the game is to throughly read the help files and ask well phrased questions.
The newbie chat is there for you to use it, do not be afraid to ask for any
information you require as longs as it's reasonable.  Grouping with others
more experienced than you is also an excellent way to gain information, do
not be afraid to ask other travellers for locations of common equipment as
it will only help you in the long run.

-1 HISTORY~
HISTORY

At the dawn of time there was only darkness.  The Chaos Machine had 
riddled the galaxies and universes with its decay, and had moved,
finally, on to greener pastures.  Astral bodies fell and fused, and
in time, planets were formed.  Little is known about the powerful 
magic's that came together to forge the lands known as Aabahran, only 
that a once lifeless husk of rock in space was born under the warmth
of a sun.  From the dawn of its existence, Aabahran was a doomed land.
It grew to full fruition in what the ancient texts called 'The Fourth
Turn".  But the relative peace was not to last.  Two dark lords 
emerged from the shadows and razed the land to ruin.  Shadowspawn, 
his only mortal name, and Virigoth emerged from the depths of a 
hellish netherworld, and took Aabahran for their own, executing
mortals and deities alike, and ravaging the land.  Dark Scourges
were born unholy births, and came to rise in power against the select
few mortals who still walked the lands.  These survivors banded 
together in small towns, and trained themselves to survive and fight
the darkness that so consumed the land.  Armies of undead poured from
the torn landscapes and assaulted the survivors, harnessing powers
and skills never before seen by any mortal.  New races and breeds of
creatures came from the woodwork, some to aid the darkness, some to
aid the survivors.  Old texts were uncovered by the survivors as they
battled back with new energies and renewed vigor until the armies
of Shadowspawn and Virigoth fell back in retreat.  From these 
survivors walked three mortal men.  Athaekeetha, Raght, and Palison
stood victorious over the ravened mountains cape of Tyr Unguld, and 
earned their place in the heavens.  Order was restored as Shadowspawn
and Virigoth spent much less of their time leading their armies to
victory, and much more battling their new immortal foes.  Once
again the survivors rebuilt the cities and lands to make way  for
the new breeds that walked forth.  All seemed once again safe...but
under the watchful, vengeful eyes of Virigoth and Shadowspawn, new
breeds of hatred burned and frothed...in time, the scourges would
once again stalk the lands...

-1 MULTI MULTI-CHAR MULTI-CHARRING MULTI-CHARACTER~
MULTI MULTI-CHAR MULTI-CHARRING MULTI-CHARACTER

Although you are allowed create and play multiple characters, multi-
charactering is NOT allowed at the Forsaken Lands.  Multi-character
is defined as any form of sharing of Out of Character actions between
two characters.  Here are some common examples (although multi-
charactering is not limited to these) :

* Having more than one character logged on at once.
* Logging on one character, giving equipment to another one of your own
  characters.
* Leaving equipment at a certain place for another one of your
  characters to pick up at a later time.
* Using leverage such as, "I used to play Bob the Warrior, so do me some
  favors."
* Logging on multiple of your own character at the same time to group or
  help one another in any way.
* Using one of your character to weaken a creature for another one of
  your characters to slay.
* Using a third person to hand equipment back and forth between
  characters.

Note: Although technically asking your friend/sibling to log on your
character and play him for you would not make you two the same people,
if the players of those characters have any relations in real life, they
may be considered as all of the same person. So, an excuse of, "But
that's my friend playing the character, not me." would not hold.

Additional Note: If you don't know what you are doing is multiing or
not, you can always pray and ask whether we allow it.  A good self-check
exercise to do is to ask yourself, "Does my character have any reason to
give this piece of equipment or grant help to this other person?"  If
you cannot give a good In Character response to that question, then you
are most likely in danger of multi-charactering.

Proxies:  If you and someone else are logged in through a proxy, then
you are not allowed to interact in any way with the other person.  You
two should not even be in the same room at any time.  If you do not
obey by these conditions, then you are considered guilty of multi'ing
regardless.

-1 NAME~
NAME

Here at the Forsaken Lands we ask our players to have a believable
fantasy name.  This name should be one would be given to an individual
at birth.   It should not be a jumble of letters.  There are no known
tongue, no matter which race, that has their name as just a jumble of
letters.

Some criteria's to think about regarding names:

* Is it a word found in the dictionary?
* Is it a combination of two names/words?
* Is it a well-known name?

We also encourage our players to choose a name that is not well known.
After all, you are given the chance to create a character with his/her
own life, with his/her own story to tell.  It is a great opportunity and
we encourage you to use it to its full potential.

LASTNAME
syntax: lastname <lastname> <lastname>

This is completely optional for players to choose.  To encourage and
enhance role-playing, characters can now choose a last name.  Just
leave it blank if you wish to abstain from choosing a last name.
There are no penalties for not having a last name.  To set a last
name if you haven't already done so at character creation, simply
type out lastname <your choice> <repeat to confirm>.  For example
if you wanted you last name to be Smith, you would type 'lastname Smith
Smith'. The command is case sensitive so remember to capitalize the
first letter of your last name if you want it capitalized. Remember, the
criteria for names also applies to last names.

others, nor quaff potions, wear equipment, or do others things regular
players may do.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible for the
actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers will incur
the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If you engage in combat with your charmed creature, your ability to control
the creature will be broken.

-1 PLAYERKILLING PKING PK PLAYERKILL 'PLAYER KILLING' ~
PLAYERKILLING PKING PK PLAYERKILL 'PLAYER KILLING'
 
Player Killing is another aspect of roleplay and should be treated as
such.  It has the potential to be an art form, and should be treated with
respect.  Violence is a major part of daily life on Forsaken Lands, and all
that we ask is that your actions are only those that would be the actions of
your character in terms of his/her role in life. 
 
You can playerkill once you have a <`1PK``> flag in front of your name. 
You will have a <`1PK``> flag in front of your name once you have gained
more than 30,000 exp points or reached level 10, whichever comes `!last``. 
 
LOOTING CORPSES
There are following conditions for looting corpses in order to make the
game more enjoyable for every one:
 
`!1``) Players cannot loot other's corpses until they have reached the rank of 10.
`!2``) PC corpses under level 15 cannot be looted at all.
`!3``) In first 2 hours after death, your corpse can be looted only by following:
        - Your group mates
        - People who are in your PK range. ("who pk")
        - Members of Thief guild.
 
Note that if you quit before retrieving your corpse, the corpse will no
longer recognize you and some of the above may not hold.  
 
PK RANGE
Pk range is determined by level and exp cost.  As, your level increases,
so does your pk range.  The range is shifted up or down depending on your
character cost compared to others.  For example, a human warrior with base
exp cost is less likely to be in the pk of a higher level as opposed to an
Elven paladin.  There is also a 8 level limit on the range in extreme cases,
to prevent higher levels from unfairly slaughtering those who happen to have
characters who cost a lot of experience to level.
 
- Expect to get PK'ed, it happens, don't take it personally.  Just gather
yourself back up and learn from the experience.
 
- Group killing is legal, groups of any size can attack another group. 
However, this should be the exception and not the norm.  Group killing
beneath the higher ranks (above 40) is discouraged and should be used
sparingly.  Those who group kill on a continuous basis will be punished. 
  
- Do not cut link to avoid being PKed, it is considered bad role-playing
and also, your character will still be vulnerable to other players while
you are link dead.
 
MULTIKILLING
Use your best judgment, sometimes enough is enough, there is no need
to kill someone over and over again. While multikilling (multiple killings
of the same player by same attacker) are allowed at high ranks (above 40)
they are discouraged and punished at low ranks.

-1 PRACTICE REHEARSE~
PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>
Syntax: REHEARSE <song>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  You may learn to
75% proficiency in a skill or spell from your guild master.  You must be at
a guild master to practice.  

REHEARSE is analogus to PRACTICE but works for songs.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will have
each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you do use
them.

Those below level 11 can't practice higher than 80% until they rank.  No one
can use a skill/spell that is at 1% as one cannot expect to learn a skill/spell 
when they have nothing as a basis.

-1 'PROMPT COLOR'~
HELP PROMPT COLOR

syntax: %l <color>
	%L

The Forsaken Lands prompt has limited ability to be color-customized.
Using the %l and %L codes it is possible to color various parts of the 
prompt.

COLOR CODES:
  In order to tell the MUD what color to insert, the "%l" has to be followed
by a single character representing a type of color.  Each of the characters
has two versions: regular (code), and bright (shift + code).
The folowing color codes can be used along with their uppercase variants:

	Normal		:	1 to 8
	Blinking	:	q to i
	Underlined	:	a to k
	Underlined+Blink:	z to ,

STARTING COLOR:
  To start a color somwhere in the prompt, simply enter %l<code> in the 
spot you wish it to start at. (<code> being one of the characters above).

ENDING COLOR:
  To end the color sequence simpy enter %L where you wish the color to end.
Not that if the MUD sets its owner color somewhere in the prompt, it will
override your settings.


Example: 
"prompt <%l!%h%Lhp %l6%m%Lm %l3%v%Lmv>"
  Will result in a prompt colored as follows:
<`!1000``hp `61000``m `31000``mv>

-1 ROLEPLAYING ROLE-PLAY ROLE-PLAYING~
ROLEPLAYING ROLE-PLAY ROLE-PLAYING

Role-playing is mandatory here at Forsaken Lands.  Role-playing is 
the ability to interact with others as the character that the player 
has created.  By choosing a role for the character that you are playing, 
you are given the chance to live a life that you are not able to live 
in the real world.  With role-playing, you are given the chance to act, 
to think as, and to hold beliefs as the character that you have created.  
This interaction between unique fantasy roles that players create is what 
makes Aabahran an interesting realm to live in.

Upon creating a character, a player is given four factors that they need
to decide about their character: race, class, alignment, and ethos.
Each of these factors can have a different effect on how the character
would be played out.  In addition, many players also chooses other character 
traits such as an unquenched mind that seeks to pursue knowledge, a person 
of sloth who is too lazy to do anything, or a philosopher who questions 
every line of theology.  Those are just a few of the examples that one may 
choose.  Of course, there are many, many more that is not said and we wish 
you the best of luck exploring the possibilities.

See also 'HELP DESC'.

Do note that players MUST stay in-character (IC) as they interact with others.  
Some out-of-character (OOC) actions are punishable by the rules.

#76
-1 QUIT SAVE~
QUIT SAVE
Syntax: quit
Syntax: save

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.

Some objects, such as keys, may not be saved.
Limited items will not be saved on characters below level 15.

You may not quit for a while after fighting.

QUIT leaves the game.  When you re-enter the realm you will be back in the 
same room.
~

#77
-1 REQUEST~
REQUEST
Syntax: request <object> <target>

Those of good aligns may request help from other good aligned creatures.
If you are experienced enough, good aligns may grant help by offering you
their gear.  However, do not abuse this privilege.  One should only
request those items that he himself would use.  Those who request items
for others would be considered to be betraying those of his align and be
shunned because if he himself does not need the item requested, he is
weakening others of his align, and does deserve such a privilege.
Often times, a person would go into a state of meditation after
requesting from another who is good aligned.  This state of meditation
may last a while, for the requester is amazed by the goodness of this
gesture from his new friend.  If attacked you will break out of the 
deep prayer, but in anger at your failings the gods often destroy the item
you strove for.

-1 TIP TIPS~
Here are some helpful tips that will help you in this realm...

- Type 'who pk' and 'where pk' a lot.  'who pk' will tell you who is in your
  pk range, and 'where pk' will tell you if there are players in your pk in
  your area.

- After level 10, you will not get any free recalls, so make sure you have
  ways to recall or teleport in case you run into noexit rooms or trouble.

- Keep a good supply of food and water when you are traveling, and always
  have a light source unless your race doesn't require one.

- Leveling in groups of 3 will give you the maximum exp.

- Always consider mobiles (mobs) that you have not seen before.

- Be careful where you sleep.  Try not to sleep in crowded or obvious
  places.

- Find out of the way places to hide when you're being attacked by other
  players.  A lot of people die trying to flee back into their guilds.

- Always keep on moving, if people can't catch you, they can't kill you.

- Explore as many areas as you can.

- It is a good idea to keep some of your money in the bank.

- Know the strengths and weakness of your character.  Find out the strengths
  and weakness of each class and race, and see which combination are better
  than others.

- DON'T STAY IN A FIGHT THAT YOU DIDN'T START.  Pking is about preparation.

-1 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE SIT~
REST SLEEP STAND WAKE
Syntax: rest	[object]
Syntax: sleep	[object]
Syntax: stand	[object]
Syntax: wake	[object]

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you regenerate
hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.  However, you are more
vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP, you won't hear many things happen.

Optionaly you may perform these commands upon an object, for roleplay or
to trigger special events.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.

of the object.

SPELL:
A healer can give up his own health to restore another's.  To commune this,
the healer must be in decent health else he/she would not survive the
spell.  The communer will be drained for a while, and cannot commune it again
until he/she has recovered from it.

-1 QUEST~
QUEST
syntax: quest

  Forsaken Lands offers an advanced dynamic quest system.  More then 
seventy (70) various quests await you as you grow in rank of your guild 
and explore the land.  The particular order of quests offered to you may 
change due to your class, race, align or pure chance with the end result 
being an experience that is never exactly the same.

 The questor screen will summarize the quests you have been assigned as
well as the tasks you have completed.  There is two types of basic quests:
permament and temporary (denoted by a <T> on "questor" screen).  While a
permament quest stays with you for duration of the character's life, the
temporary quests are short tasks often needed to complete a larged quests
and are reset with each world shift or when you leave the lands.

 Almost all the quests offer rewards.  Most often this reward is in shape
of experience and gold or items.  Many others will also grant bonus train
points or practices and other various beneficial things.

Word of caution: While many quests are meant to be completed in groups, 
you should NEVER give solution to the quests to anyone.  Part of the fun
and excitement is to solve the quests, and the Immortals harshly punish
anyone who defies this rule.

-1 TICK HOUR~
TICK

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 25 seconds to 35 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if someone is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

#90
-1 TRAIN~
TRAIN
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several initial
training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by using these sessions
at a trainer (there are several scattered throughout the realm).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase mana
or hp by 10.  You receive one training session every five levels.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice sessions when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points. In
the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train WIS and CON
both to the max for your race before practicing or training anything else.

Syntax: whois <name>
Syntax: bio <name>
Syntax: who newbie
Syntax: who group
Syntax: who description (IMMORTAL ONLY)

WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently

With arguments, WHO can show a selected group of people.  For example:

WHO PK shows all the visible players you may kill.

WHO <CABAL NAME> shows all the visible members of a cabal (only if you are in
that cabal).

WHO <RACE> shows all the visible players of a certain race.

WHO RELIGION shows all the visible players of your religion

WHO TATTOO shows all the visible players who bears the same tattoo as you.

WHOIS identifies any user who matches the name given. For example, 'whois a'
shows all characters whose name begins with A.


WHO NEWBIE shows all the newbie players that are on, making it easier for
newbies to find groups

WHO GROUP shows all the players within 9 levels of you.  Which is basically
the people you can group with.

BIO shows personal information about a player.

#94
-1 WIMPY~
WIMPY
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to
flee.  You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e.
has not been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit
points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

#95
60 ADVANCE~
ADVANCE
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the only way
to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE may also be used
to demote characters.
~

#96
60 TRUST~
TRUST
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect on
combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or immortal)
characters to give them access to more power without messing up the character.
You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

#97
59 DENY~
DENY
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.

59 PROTECT~
PROTECT
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.

#99
59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN 'WORLD SHIFT'~
REBOOT SHUTDOWN
Syntax: reboot <# of ticks> [count/color/purge/wipe]
        shutdown

Reboot invokes the hot reboot sequence.  It is like a regular reboot in all
aspects except that players are not disconnected from the mud.  Reboot without
an argument reboots immediately.  Reboot with a number starts the timer to
reboot in a certain amount of ticks.  Reboot -1 stops the reboot squence.

Maintance options may be specified to be performed on reboot with following:
- count	: Counts pflies for Limited item avaliability.
- color	: Colors room names
- purge : Purges limited items from pflies accorind to amount of time played
	  previous month.
- wipe	: Wipes pfiles that have not logged in for 20 + (2 x level) days.
- helps	: Generates new set of class/skill helps files from current setup.
- stats	: Generates statistics on all races/cabal and sends to immortal
- all	: Does all of above

Multiple options maybe passed ex: "reboot 4 color wipe purge" without significant
extra reboot time penalty.  Purge, Wipe and Count count pfiles automaticly.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

-1 REBOOT WORLDSHIFT 'WORLD SHIFT' WORLD SHIFT~
REBOOT

Occasionally an immortal requires that the mud be rebooted so that a change
can be put into effect.  Other times the shared strings reach the max usage,
and the mud needs to be rebooted to prevent high cpu usage.  And almost all
crashes can be detected and a reboot occurs.  All these reboots are what we
call hot reboots, in which players do not lose link, but rather, they just
experience a lag for a couple seconds while the mud reboots.

Here is a list of what is saved during reboots.
All cabal items.
All eq in pits unless they are melt_drop.
All corpses on the ground.
All eq on the ground unless they are melt_drop or repop in that room.

Here is a list of what is not saved during reboots.
Equipment on mobs (this includes your charmies).

PERMQUEST TEMPQUEST REMQUEST

Syntax: Permquest <char> <text>
	Inviquest <char> <text>
	Tempquest <char> <text>
	Remquest <char> <text/number>

These command handle the attachement and removal of the quest text in
"questor" screen.  Quests set by Tempquest will not be saved on character
and hence will be cleared on re-login. (Mostly usefull in scripted quests)

Quest set by Inviquest are visible to Imms only and do not count towards
master quest.  They are useful mostly for marking behind the scene flags
in quests.

The <text> part is exactly what is shown on the  "questor" screen.
If you use permquest or tempquest on already existing quest, its perm/temp
status will be change accordingly.

Remquest can be passed the text of the quest to remove, OR the position 
number on the list.

58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
ALLOW BAN PERMBAN
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
        ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by using "goodname") banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentally lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.

FOR ALL <action>
FOR MORTALS <action>
FOR GODS <action>
FOR MOBS <action>
FOR EVERYWHERE <action>

Executes action several times, either on ALL players (not including yourself),
MORTALS (including trusted characters), GODS (characters with level higher
than L_HERO), MOBS (Not recommended) or every room (not recommended either!)

If you insert a # in the action, it will be replaced by the name of the
target.

If # is a part of the action, the action will be executed for every target in
game. If there is no #, the action will be executed for every room containing
at least one target, but only once per room. # cannot be used with FOR
EVERY-WHERE. # can be anywhere in the action.

Example:

FOR ALL SMILE -> you will only smile once in a room with 2 players.
FOR ALL TWIDDLE # -> In a room with A and B, you will twiddle A then B.

Destroying the characters this command acts upon MAY cause it to fail.  Try
to avoid something like FOR MOBS PURGE.

FOR MOBS TRANS 3054 (transfer ALL the mobs to Midgaard temple) does NOT Work
though. :)

SET
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
        set obj   <object> <field> <value>
        set room  <number> <field> <value>
        set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
        set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.

given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

#105
57 DISCONNECT~
DISCONNECT
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

#106
57 FREEZE~
FREEZE
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle, which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

#107
57 SLAY~
SLAY
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

#108
56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
WIZLOCK NEWLOCK
Syntax: wizlock
        newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks out all
non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who are
returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically used
for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided, and
newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

#109
57 PARDON~
PARDON
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
        pardon <character> thief

are sure they deserve it.
~

#110
56 LOAD~
LOAD
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
        load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are put
in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old format
objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new format
objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set. (see also
clone, vnum, stat)
~

#111
56 PURGE~
PURGE
Syntax: purge
        purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag set
(i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be purged if
they are called directly by name.
~

#112
56 RESTORE~
RESTORE
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore room
        restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

#113
56 SOCKETS~
SOCKETS
Syntax: sockets
        sockets <name>

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed
in merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

#114
56 VNUM~
VNUM
Syntax: vnum <name>
        vnum <obj or mob> <name>
        vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out the
results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is very
useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and the slot
number (for making new zones) of a skill name.  (see also load)
~

#115
55 LOG SNOOP~
LOG SNOOP
Syntax: log   <character>
        log   all
        snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

#116
55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL
Syntax: nochannel <character>
        noemote   <character>
        noshout   <character>
        notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

#117
55 PEACE~
PEACE
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

#118
55 STRING~
STRING
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
        string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

#119
55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
TRANSFER TELEPORT
Syntax: transfer <character>
        transfer all
        transfer <character> <location>
        transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters, to your
current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all should almost
never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have horrible effects
on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.
~

#120
54 AT~
AT
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of a mobile,
or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the command,
and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your location).
~

#121
54 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
ECHO GECHO PECHO
Syntax: echo  <message>
        gecho <message>
        pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to all
characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent it.
Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho sends the
message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level god will see
a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it is an echo.
~

#122
54 SWITCH RETURN~
SWITCH RETURN
Syntax: switch <character>
        return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not already
have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot switch
into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

#123
53 FORCE~
FORCE
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.  This is
typically used for 'force all save'.
~

#124
53 MWHERE~
MWHERE
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

#125
53 STAT~
STAT
Syntax: stat <name>
        stat mob  <name>
        stat obj  <name>
        stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room (if
a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.  (see also goto,
transfer)
~

#126
52 AFK REPLAY~
AFK REPLAY
Syntax: afk
Syntax: replay

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell to
you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing recall.
This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes, but don't
want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

#127
52 CLONE~
CLONE
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your possession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items, which are too high for you to clone.
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

#128
52 GOTO~
GOTO
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the
name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

#129
52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS
Syntax: holylight
        wizinvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum (your
level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally invisible.
~

#130
52 INCOGNITO~
INCOGNITO
Syntax: incognito
Syntax: incognito <level>

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regardless of location.
~

#131
52 MEMORY~
MEMORY
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

#132
-1 PMOTE SMOTE~
PMOTE SMOTE
Syntax: pmote <action>
Syntax: smote <action>

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

#133
52 POOFIN POOFOUT~
POOFIN POOFOUT
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and 'leaves in
a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of your own
choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages must include
your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.  (see also goto)
~

#134
51 IMMTALK :~
IMMTALK :
Syntax: immtalk <message>
        immtalk

on).
~

#135
52 WIZNET~
WIZNET
Syntax: wiznet
        wiznet show
        wiznet status

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to the
wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, wiznet show
lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), wiznet status shows
your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles a field on and off.
The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not, fiddle with them a
while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~

#136
51 WIZHELP~
WIZHELP
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.

#137
-1 COFFIN~
COFFIN
Syntax: coffin

Used by vampires during the day to hide from their enemies and to heal from the
exhaustion caused by the daylight.  A vampire can choose not to coffin during
the day, but in turn, will have serious consequence until they have seeked
shelter in their coffins.
~

#138
-1 DRAIN~
DRAIN
Syntax: drain <corpse>

Seeking to quench their seemingly unsatiable hunger for blood, vampires can
drain the blood from fresh corpse, which in turn will increase the health
of the vampire, as well as temporarily supressing their hunger.  As the
rank of the vampire rises, they will require the blood from stronger foes,
as weak enemies gradually decrease in effectiveness.
~

#139
-1 WANTED~
WANTED
 
A flag given to a character who has broken the laws set in the city.  For
more information on laws, type 'HELP LAW'.  While wanted, all guards will
attack you on sight, and most shopkeepers will not sell you goods.  A wanted
flag may only be removed by Justice, or through serving a full sentance in 
Aabahran's Jails.  
 
The amount of time which you will be wanted depends on which town you are
convicted in.  What is considered an atrosity in one city, may be a petty
offense in another.  The amount of time will be displayed by typing 'score'.
Keep in mind that those who repeatedly break the law will soon find themselves
outlaws.

#140
-1 'OWNER ONLY' OWNER ONLY~
OWNER ONLY

Certain items in the lands, can be bound to a particular player hence becoming
flagged as "owner only".  Items so marked can only be touched or held by their
repective owner and will "zap" anyone else who tries to pick them up.  If the
owner is a "ghost", or the item lies on cabal grounds it cannot be sacrificed
or destroyed as long as the item's owner remains in the land.

~

#141
-1 RARE LIMITED UNIQUE~
RARE ITEMS

Certain items in the lands are avaliable in limited quantities only and hence
are called "rare", or "unique".  Such Limited items only become created in the
game if the number of existing items of that type is less then some amount 
specified by  the original creator, and in case of "rare" items modifed 
according to current player base size.  Often the only way to gain such Limited
items is to kill their current owner, and take them from their still warm
corpse.

LIMITED ITEM RESTRICTIONS
Number of specific limitations are imposed onto Limited items:
- You cannot pick them up untill your rank is of 15 or more.
- You cannot put a Limited item into most containers avaliable.
- you cannot put a Limited intem into a storage locker.
- There is a specific limit on how many Limited items you can 
  save in your inventory (More below)
- Inactive characters will have their Limited items purged. (More below)

PURGED LIMITED ITEMS
While your character can WEAR as many rare items as you wish, there is a limit
on how many Limited items will be saved on your character when you quit. This
prevents hogging the precious commodity and makes the game more fair for all. 
The limit is calculated as follows:

Items in inventory saved = (Level / 10) - 1

ex: At level 15 you can safely hold: (15/10) - 1 = 0 items in inventory.
    at level 20 you can safely hold: (20/10) - 1 = 1 item in inventory.

Finaly if you do not use your character enough during a period of a month,
its rare items will be automaticly removed and returned to circulation.
~

#142
-1 STAIN STAINED~
STAIN STAINED

Items touched or affected by an Immortal power in any way become <`!STAINED``>
with their touch.  Any mortal who touches such power, will in turn become
so stained.  In order to avoid needless questioning, and potential punishement
a mortal should report a sighting of a stained item at once, and never let
their flesh touch upon the item.
~

#143
-1 OUTCAST~
OUTCAST

A flag given to a character who has turned from their path and no longer
accepted by his guild.  While outcasted, you are no longer part of any
affliation, except if you're in a cabal.  Only an immortal can remove
the flag. Actions deemed unacceptable by the guild, such as attacking
one's own guild guardian, will result in the outcast flag.

Note that those who have had their alignment changed to something that
is frowned upon by their race (for example, an evil gnome) will be
outcasted. However, not all outcasts will have their alignment changed.

Outcast flag will cause following:
- Loss of all spells and communing powers if your align is not allowed
  by your current race.
- The Guild guardian will no longer allow you into your guild.
- You will have to bribe the guildmaster in order to practice.
- Your deity will exact heavy toll on you for each time you recall.

As well as other minor hardships.

~

#145
-1 EDITOR~
DESCRIPTION EDITOR

In addition to the old way of entering description, you
may now use the MUD's OLC editor to enter your descriptions
as well.  The prime difference between the two is that the
OLC editor allows for "pasting" of whole chunks of lines
without any hassle of a in editor typing ".h" on empty line followed by <enter>
will show the editors commands.  Use ".c" <enter> to clear
the desc, and "@" <enter> to finish.

Here is an example of how to use the new editor.

1) "desc edit" to enter OLC editor.

2) paste your description in, or type it line by line

3) ".s" <enter> on empty line to see what you have so far.

4) ".f" <enter> on empty line to format it (The format will
respect empty lines, so you can generate paragraphs).

5) "@" <enter> to finish and return to normal game mode.

The Forsaken Lands are overseen by a group of beings who have been
elevated from the masses.  From their lofty perch among the heavens
they watch down over their flock, delivering unto them both woe and
weal.
 
If you feel that you are plagued with a matter that requires divine
intervention, 'pray' your concern to the heavens above, and if your
problem is judged worthy, you will be granted audience.  Be warned
however...  Beseeching the heavens for paltry matters will bring the
wrath of the offended God upon your head.
 
Should you require to scribe a scroll to all of the Immortals in
general, simply scribe a 'note to immortal' and a messenger will
speed your correspondence away.  A similar warning to the misuse of
'pray' is given.

RAID Syntax:    raid				: shows city numbers
		raid <city #> <raid strength>	: starts a raid

Certain cabals in the Aabahran are known to pay for and organize raiding
parties against the major cities of the lands.  

When a city is raided, the invaders will slowly yet systematically destroy
it.  Each razed room will result in a bounty to the invading cabal, and a
penalty to the owner of the city.  If the city is lawful the Justice cabal
will also incur penalties as the raiders torch the buildings one by one.

#152
-1 VIRIGOTH UNLIFE~
For each day, there is a night, for each shadow there is light, and for 
each Life to begin one must end. Such is the balance of the realm.

During the Fourth Age of Aabahran when the armies of Chaos ravaged and 
corrupted the realm, a small scouting force of the main host of Chaos
happened upon a ruined mausoleum on what is now known as Isle of Souls. 
The force was led by one of the host's countless commanders, one bearing 
the name of Virigoth.

What happened is not known even to Shadowspawn himself, yet the whole force 
was lost with exception of the commander who returned alone and changed. 
His complexion paled, eyes glazed he returned only by virtue of his mount. 
His mind lost he clutched an ancient executioner blade in his hands its 
tip blunt and blade rusted beyond use. Deemed unfit for battle he was 
disposed of as the host of Chaos moved on. Twas said that two nights later 
a man pale and ghostly bearing great resemblance to the dead commander, 
lured number of soldiers from the camps with promises of great loot and 
treasure. They left in the night armed with tools for digging, heading 
towards the dragon sea never to return.

Not soon after the foreboding rumors begun to arise in Aabahran. Newborns
and elderly dieing in scores, whole villages consumed by plagues. Even 
the very earth was at unrest as corpses and remains were expelled from the 
ground. It was at that time when the ancient force of death and decay first 
came upon the land consuming the fortress of Light known as S'handar in but 
a single hour. Calling itself Virigoth it breathed its foul taint across 
the land spawning such disease and foul undead as the land has not known in 
millennia. The forces of light were pushed back as whole armies of Vampires,
Liches and lower undead arose from the ground to march with the hosts of
Chaos.

History progressed and eventually the armies of Chaos and Undead were beat 
back, only feeding Virigoth's power as legions of beings gave up their souls 
in defense of the realm. Now It watches over its minions in the land, as
the shadows build around the Isle of Souls awaiting the right time to once
again engulf the land in their cold grasp.

Virigoth is the embodiment of death and decay in Aabahran, often deity of 
choice for necromancers, executioners and morticians. It represents the 
inevitable end of all that is natural and the counterbalance to forces of
life. Those who worship It, worship not the act of death but the inescapable 
collapse of life and its eventual end which allows the cycle of rebirth and 
creation to continue. It holds power over all things of Aabahran that ceased 
their natural life, and not even its name is spoken out loud in fear of 
sickness and death it brings. The foreboding mark of a snarling skull is a 
common symbol around graveyards of Aabahran. Engraved for protection of the 
deceased to ward of grave robbers, alive and not. It is rumored that a whole 
cult exists in Virigoth's name, yet to even enquire about its existence is to 
court death.

HELP TIME

The Aabahran's calendar is divided into two time periods. B.C. and P.C. B.C.
Defines the time 'Before Cataclysm', which is to say the time before the
great weaving of the lands by the very force of unlife. P.C. stands for 
'Post Cataclysm', the time we live in now, after the destruction of mortal 
life.

-1 ROYAL ROYALITY~
HELP ROYAL

Royalty, a concept few can truly master.  To lead an entire town away from
the tides of chaos and death that haunt Aabahran.  A position that requires
strict discipline, diplomacy, and patience.  

Those of the royal houses of Aabahran are chosen by immortality to lead
entire towns, with the assistance of the noble house.  Each of the three
city-states will have two of the royal house to lead, while the rest of the
towns will have one to lead.  Royalty is limited to only those that are
truly an example of greatness.  

The Royal house controls their town with power and diplomacy, and they shall
be responsible for all that happens within the walls of their town.  They
are also responsible for grooming potential new blood within the Noble clan
hall.  At any time a royal shrugs his or her duty, they will be demoted, or
removed from the house all together.  

If you are already of noble blood, and your city has an opening for a new
member of the Royal house, scribe an APPLICATION to immortal with the words
"Royal application" in the subject line.  Within the application, include
all qualifications and reasons why you should be accepted into royalty.  

All mortals should realize that disrespecting a member of either the Royal
or Noble house is not only unwise on a mortal level, but you run the risk of
invoking the anger of the gods them-self.

                         ** `6The Rules of FL``  **
                         **********************

`!RULES AND CONDUCT FOR ALL IMMORTALS``
---------------------------------------

You have been chosen from the mortal ranks because the staff
at the Forsaken Lands has decided that you exemplify all of
the virtues of excellent character, and that you would be an
asset to our staff. Like any reward, what can be given, can
be taken away. So, we have prepared a listing of general rules
and regulations, as well as code of conduct to abide by, as
an Immortal. Feel free to refer to this file at any time.

1.`&RANK ALLOCATIONS``
--------------------

Ranks are achieved here by your worth to the staff. The more time
you spend as a lower level immortal, the more your value to the
staff will increase. You are given ranks ONLY by IMPLEMENTORS,
namely, the Staff Administrator. You are NEVER to ask for advancement
at any time. It will be given to you as you EARN it. By spending time 
as a lower level Immortal, you will be undergoing your trial (often called
'gimp') period. Once you have shown your use to us, you may be advanced.

2. `&RESPECT``
-------------- 

As an Immortal, you are to show respect to ALL higher ranking
Immortals. Any disrespect, disobedience, or harassment by any
lower Immortal to a higher ranking Immortal will be subject to
immediate punishment, and/or dismissal. If you have a problem with
any Immortal, please bring it to an IMPLEMENTOR's attention. If
the decision of the IMPLEMENTOR does not suit you, you are free
to enter 'delete' twice.

3.`&GENERAL RULES``
-----------------

There is a hierarchy within the heavens. While we are all staff
members, we also follow a strict code of ranks. Immortal ranks
list from level 51 (HERO) to level 58 (SUPREMITY). Characters of
rank 59 (CREATOR) and 60 (IMPLEMENTOR) are reserved for the most
senior staffmembers. GENERAL rules are observed by ALL Immortals
of rank 51-58. Creators and Implementors do not have to observe
general rules if other circumstances require it.

    a) An IMMORTAL is NEVER to interfere directly with a mortal.
       This includes giving equipment to mortals, aiding mortals
       in slaying creatures or characters, slaying a mortal, or
       otherwise inhibiting a mortal's gameplay.

    b) An IMMORTAL is authorized to enact punishment to a mortal
       ONLY under the following circumstances:

       1) Direct violation of preset rules.
       2) Direct disobedience to a staffmember.
    
    c) Punishment MUST be preceeded by two verbal warnings to
       the mortal. If you decide to exact punishment, you are
       REQUIRED to write a 'penalty' to IMMORTAL, stating who was
       punished, and for what reason.

    d) NEVER use Immortal information you have gathered to
       further your own mortal character.

    e) Immortals are ALLOWED to play mortal characters, but can
       NOT login with a mortal until 15 minutes AFTER they have
       logged out with their Immortal. 

    f) You are to respect and obey the commands sent down to you
       from the upper chain of command.

Failure to comply with any of these rules is grounds for immediate
demotion and/or explusion from the Immortal ranks.

4. `&ADDITIONAL RULES``
-----------------------

Several additional rules have been amended. They are listed here,
as follows.

    a) Immortals are not authorized to have more than one mortal
       character of Elder cabal rank.

    b) Immortals are not authorized to have mortals in opposing
       cabals. (ie, One Knight, one Nexus).

    c) Immortals are NEVER allowed to divulge information about
       the Forsaken Lands to ANY other MUD. Immortals are NOT
       allowed to be associated as a staffmember on ANY other MUD.
       (You are welcome to play any other mud, you just cannot be
       an immortal there).
   
    d) Many of you will have been brought up from a cabal. You are welcome 
       to keep your player character within that cabal, however, as an 
       Immortal, you will never be allowed to hold a position of LEADER 
       within that cabal. It is also frowned upon to have a player 
       character within the cabal that you are the Immortal of, though it 
       is not illegal. If you do, be sure to follow all rules very 
       closely.

    e) This section is subject to further amendments without any
       advance notice.

Failure to comply with any of these rules is grounds for immediate
demotion and/or explusion from the Immortal ranks.

5. `7RANK AND DUTIES``
----------------------

The following is a list of all expected duties of Immortals at their
ranks. While this list is not absolute, it does cover the basic jobs
of all staffmembers.

`!Hero Level:``
`#Level 51:`` These are above average mortals whom have applied for
the status of Hero. ("help hero").  They cannot hold limited equipment,
and cannot engage in combat with other mortals.  They can however fight
and kill other Heros.

`!Avatar Level:``
`#Level 52 - 53 :`` These Immortals are newly inducted staffmembers. They
MAY have been brought up to lead a cabal. They are the most junior
members of the staff, and have very few powers. They are REQUIRED to
stay visible at all times. Their primary jobs are approving descriptions,
approving names, answering questions on the newbie channel, and conduct-
ing affairs in their cabal, if applicable.

`!Enforcer Levels:``
`#Level 54 - 56 :`` These are Enforcer Immortals. Enforcer Immortals 
monitor the MUD using the 'socket' and 'matchip' commands. They are 
required to perform the same duties as the HERO level Immortals, and as 
well catch cheaters and multi-players. They are authorized to be invisible 
from time to time to catch cheaters. Their primary jobs are catching 
cheaters, answering prays, monitoring Hero level Immortals, and conducting 
affairs in their cabal, if applicable.

`!Advanced Levels:`` (At least one completed area is required)
`#Level 57 - 58 :`` These are senior level Immortals. Senior Immortals 
generally conduct business with Creators and Implementors in the form of 
bug reports, typo reports, and as well answer questions of lower level 
Immortals. Many Advanced Level Immortals are assigned Hero level Immortals 
to indoctrinate. They are occasionally visible to answer questions, but 
more often are the focus of RP Plots, quests, and rule enforcement.

`!Senior Staff:``
`#Level 59 :`` These immortals are seldom visible. They are the only liasons
between the IMPLEMENTORS and the rest of the staff. They exist to create
RP Plots, quests, and answer questions from the lower staff, or direct
questions from staffmembers to Implementors. Senior staff are often 
deities, and issue tattoos.

`!Implementors:``
`#Level 60 :`` These are the administrators of the MUD. Their power is 
absolute. They are NEVER questioned or harassed. They are RARELY visible as 
they are often coding, fixing bugs, building, fixing typos, or otherwise 
working on the mechanics of the game. They have ultimate, and absolute power.
Basically, don't mess with them.

If you are caught in direct disobedience to any higher ranking staffmember,
you can be demoted and/or discharged.

6. `&CONDUCT``
--------------

You are reponsible for good conduct while you are here. If you are caught
cheating, you will be penalized. We have instilled an amount of trust in 
you, and if you betray that trust, expect the repercussions.

Do not send useless echos or emotes to players. You are here to help game
play, not impede it.

You are not to walk around with your `!ego`` on your sleeve. You are here, 
as a staffmember, to do a professional job. Treat players with respect. We 
are here to cater to players, after all. A mud with no players would be a 
very boring place. Treat newbies with respect, since newbies tend to be 
return visitors, and will tell friends. The more experience players we 
get, the more exciting we will become. Remember, you too were a newbie, 
once.

Any Immortal who steps out of line will be punished. Rules and guidelines 
have been set. Just because you are staff here does not give you the right 
to insult, mock, or disrespect players.

Certain players who spam, advertise for other muds, trash kill, or cheat, 
are to be dealt with firmly, and harshly. Many times, they do not know 
they are doing anything wrong. Please deal with them accordingly.

7. `&SUMMATION``
----------------

These rules are subject to review and change at any time. Please keep 
yourself updated and familiar with all Immortal Rules from time to time. 
If you have any questions, feel free to contact a liason, or an Implementor.

~

#167
-1 RULE RULES~
RULE RULES

These are the rules of the Forsaken Lands.  The are made to make your
experience here more enjoyable.  They are also here to make the game more
"fair" for everyone.

* Player stealing and player killing is allowed here to a reasonable
  extent.  All kills should have a RP reason behind it.  However, do
  not spam prays to the heavens about the wrong doings that lead to your
  death.  The immortal will only step in when he/she decides that person
  has been killing excessively.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods,
  and you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to
  be sent to the implementors.

* NO multiple logins, multiple playing, or multicharring.  (For more
  information, read 'help MULTI'.)  Further, if any evidence is found
  implying that you and/or others are allowing your character's lives
  and/or actions to be affected by anything ooc, you will be severely
  punished (ie, no forums, no chats, no icq).  OOC knowledge will always
  play a part, but make sure that your role is not obviously affected. 
  If you are sharing a connection via a proxy server, then you are not 
  allowed to interact in anyway with the other person.  You two should 
  never be in the same room, you will be guilty of multi'ing nevertheless.

* DO NOT exploit a bug in any way, shape or form.  If you see a bug or have
  knowledge of a bug, report it to the immortals.

* DO NOT SPAM.  Spamming is filling up someone's screen with things.  For
  example, send a tell, do a say or emote over and over just to annoy
  someone.  You will be warned once and then action will be taken after
  that.  Another form of spamming is typing the same command over and
  over again.  You can avoid that type of spamming by typing a different
  command in between.

* Forsaken Lands is a PG-13 MUD. Any form of intimitate sexual behavior 
and excessive use of present day curses, or ANY form of sexual harassment 
will be dealt with in a harsh and effective manner. 


* These rules are simple, and clear, if you violate them, it will be
  considered cheating.  Cheating will not be tolerated.  If you are caught
  violating these rules you will be punished according, depending on the
  situation and previous offenses.

* Though scripting for your characters are not illegal, however leaving them
  on "life-support" is.  If you leave your characters unattended, such
  "out of body experiences" will be dealt with accordingly.

* The Implementors made the rules, they reserve the right to add or change
  any of the rules as they see fit.  So when they tell you not to do something,
  don't.  And don't bother arguing to them about it.

#171
-1 DRUID DRUIDS~
DRUID
 
Druids are the purest embodiment of nature. The live to serve
only Gaia, the Earth Mother, and are perhaps some of the most
ancient of the sages in Aabahran. By nature, Druids are communers,
as they use the forces of the Forest to cast their own spells
of protection and healing. Powerful healers and quite knowing
of the ways of natural herbs and healing remedies, a Druid is
a very smart companion to know, as they can provide certain
types of healing even those of the Healer profession cannot.
 
Druids are the predecessors of the modern Ranger class, and
while they have many of the same combat abilities, they are
much more aloof, and clerical than the fighting class of the
Ranger.
 
As a Druid's home is within the forest, while he is away from
the forest, he will experience yearning (HELP YEARNING) the
longer he remains away.
 
A druid will find his guildmasters residing within a forest
only, as druids by nature dislike population and the crowd of
a city. They are rural creatures, and come out of the forest
very seldomly.
 
If you desire to join the order of Druids, you must be of NEUTRAL
align and be either a HUMAN or WEREBEAST ranger of no more or less 
than the 30th rank.  Upon reaching this rank, inquire at the Ranger
Guild.

NOTE: YOU MAY NOT BECOME A DRUID WHILE CABALED.

See also: HELP YEARNING
~

#172
-1 YEARNING~
While a druid parts from a forest, and wanders the lands, he
will find that he eventually becomes affected by the Yearning.
As a druid is raised and lives off of a forest, the longer he
is away from the forest, the more this yearning will harm him.
However, once he returns to the forest, he will find that the
yearning ceases.
~

#173
-1 ROM~
ROM

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

#174
-1 LUCK~
LUCK
										
Luck is exactly what it sounds like.  In cases that luck is involved,
that's where it will come in.  It does not play a role in determining
the outcome of most cases.  In fact, while your luck is high, you
might not be real lucky playing wise.  There's no need to worry that
your luck is low when you've created your character, because luck
fluctuates during the course of your life.  Unlike other attributes,
luck cannot be trained, but there are certain items/spells that will
enhance your luck.

~

#175
-1 COLOR~
COLOR

syntax: color <setting>

Toggles the status of various color settings.  Avaliable settings are:

color:		Main ON/OFF switch for mud color
damage:		Color Coding of damage messages 
		`1RED``		= done to you
		`3YELLOW``	= done by you
		`8GREY``	= done by others


~

#176
-1 SHED~
SHED
Syntax: SHED

Sliths have been known to be akin to snakes. Hence, in combat, a slith
is able to 'shed' a cast of skin to help aid him in combat. This cast
of skin is a near transparent replica of the original slith, and has
been known to instill fear into a foe while fighting. Generally, the
shod skin cannot withstand the rigors of battle, and soon crumbles
into dust.

~

#177
-1 SWALLOW~
SWALLOW
Syntax: SWALLOW <corpse>

Much like their reptilian cousins, sliths have hingable jaws. They
are known to feed on corpses by merely swallowing them whole. This
provides ample sustenance for a hungry slith.

~

#178
-1 OUTLAW~
OUTLAWS

Outlaws have been forsaken by the laws of the land. They are criminals
who have been deemed by justice to be irrepairable, and who are now
not protected by the laws of cities. Outlaws may be attacked by anyone,
anywhere, without chance for repercussion by Justice.  They are the worst 
criminals of the land, and, as thus, they are killed on a spot when apprehended,
and never lose their WANTED flags.

#179
-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
RACE RACES
 
The Forsaken Lands has the following races for player characters:
 
 Human        0 extra   The standard race, average attributes.

agile, both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but

the dark.

-1 GIANT GIANTS~
Giants (not to be confused with Ogres) are the largest of the races, 
ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They are stronger than any other 
race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  They aren't too bright, 
however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy than the other 
races.  There are three different types of giants in Aabahran.

See: STORM, STONE, FIRE
~

#187
-1 STORM~
STORM

Storm giants are the most intelligent of giants.  They live in cities 
built underwater and on the land surrounding bodies of water.  Despite 
being civilized, however, they are still rough and quick to ire, and 
their chaotic tendencies have caused them to being dubbed 'Storm' giants 
by humans.

Like all giants, storm giants have a size advantage over most adventurers,
and are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants
an innate mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their
slow minds make them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells.  Storm giants
are uniquely resistant to lightning, and can travel above and below water
without the aid of a boat, and their natural affinity for watery grounds
grants them large skill bonus when on water.
However, storm giants cannot use wooden equipment in their adventures, 
much as elves shun the touch of iron.  Despite their unpredictability, 
they are followers of the Light.

Storm giants can be the following classes:
Warrior, Berserker, Cleric.
~

#188
-1 STONE~
STONE
 
Stone giants inhabit the wilderness of Aabahran, and live by using their brute
strength to crush their prey when they hunt.  However, much as other giants,
their raw strength makes them very clumsy when it comes to avoiding attacks.
Stone giants are natural wanderers, and are often found alone in places away
from crowds.  They are largely ignorant of cities and laws.
 
Like all giants, stone giants have a size advantage over most adventurers,
and are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants
an innate mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their
slow minds make them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells. Having no 
additonal resistances they also lack any true weaknesses. They are neutral 
in alignment.
 
Stone Giants, unlike the others possess the ability to use boulders as
thrown weapons in certain types of terrain.
 
Stone giants can be the following classes:
Warrior, Ranger, and Berserker.
~

#189
-1 FIRE~
FIRE

Fire giants are found in the mountainsides, especially in volcanic wastes.
Typically living in small villages, they often fight among themselves to
establish power and ranking within their crude communities.  Fire giants
are also known to quarrel with goblins and orcs over living space and
hunting grounds, although they are not smart enough to organize themselves
to fight full-scale wars.

Like all giants, fire giants have a size advantage over most adventurers,
and are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants
an innate mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their
slow minds make them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells.  Like their
name implies, fire giants have adapted themselves to their hot surrounds,
and are thus resistant to fire, and extremely adept with any weapons made
of fire, or causing fiery damage.  However, ice attacks are foreign 
to them, and they are vulnerable to such attacks.  They are naturally evil.

Fire giants can be the following classes:
Warrior, Cleric, and Berserker.

#190
-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
HALFLING HALFLINGS

Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small
humans, averaging 3 and 1/2 feet tall.  Their faces are round and broad
and often quite florid.  Their hair typically curly and the tops of
their feet are covered with coarse hair.  Their typical life expectancy
is approximately 150 years.

Halflings are sturdy and industrious, generally quiet and peaceful.
Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring.
However, though they may never look for adventure, they have a strange
knack for stumbling across them.  And, more than occasionally,
adventure finds them.  Because of their lives filled with collecting
comforts and trinkets, they have the benefit of above average wisdom, a
result of their life experiences.

Halflings are not forward, but they are observant and conversational if
in friendly company.  They see wealth only as a means of gaining
creature comforts, which they love.  Although Halflings are about the
same height as gnomes, their stout and sturdy build gives them a hearty
constitution.  And, because of their size and light weight as well as
their peace loving nature, they've grown amazingly agile and dexterous,
able to dodge many of the attacks of those who seek to harm them.
Halflings make excellent thieves, as they seek to avoid direct conflicts
by relying on their speed and agility to get them out of dangerous
situations.  They are lacking, however, in strength, due to their small
size and peaceful lifestyles.

Elves generally like Halflings in a patronizing sort of way.  Dwarves
cheerfully tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat soft and harmless.
Gnomes, although they drink more and eat less, like halflings best,
feeling them kindred spirits.  Halflings are more open and outgoing than
any of the above races, so they get along with other races far better.

Halflings can be the following classes: 
Warrior, Thief, Cleric, Blademaster and Ranger.

#191
-1 DEMON DEMONS~
DEMON DEMONS
 
In the Fourth Age of Aabahran, the demon Shadowspawn came from the Chaos Rift
and tore Aabahran and its populace asunder with the screams and torments of
the Chaos Demons. These vile creatures were unlike any Aabahran had seen.
They did not speak a language any knew, and their names were so vile and
repulsive to speak that they were connoted nicknames to describe their
pleasures. Malice, Agony, Lightbane...Many names used by mortals to 
describe the pure evil that had been borne into the lands.
 
Demons are not living beings, but nor are they dead or undead. They are
the result of a thousand damned souls intertwined into a single mind.
Since they are already doomed by the gods they are immune to the curses
you may attempt to bind them with.  Their horribly disfigured bodies are
often covered in thick cloths, and they avoid daylight and gatherings,
often preferring to work underground in the darkness. Having no normal
spoken dialect, they speak only telepathically augmenting their power
with magic in order to be heard by others.
 
Demons are not born into these realms.  Rather a willing mortal submits
his body to Shadowspawn, and if found worthy he is taken over by a Demon
thus becoming one of the unholy race. A tortured mind is often the exact
catalyst he needs to forge a Demon. If, for some reason, you feel you have
earned a fate worse that death, and wish to serve as one of these Dark
Lords, send an application to Immortal with your inquiry. Be warned,
however...They do not tolerate foolishness. Only the truly blackest
of hearts will enter into the Demonic Kin. Be wary.

-1 OGRE OGRES~
OGRE OGRES

the giants they are sometimes mistaken for.  Having similiar frame they
possess increadible metabolism granting them great strength and speed.
They heal at an unheard of rate and posses consitution and health that
far surpasses any other race. This vitality comes at a cost as they are 
quite vulnerable to magic in all its forms.  While they are unwise and
foolish at best, they posses suprising intelligence often making ogres
excelt choice for martial classes such as warrior.  Ogres live in small
nomadic villages moving often as they forage for food and prey.  The 
social order is quite undeveloped and thier language skills leave much
to be desired.  In terms of alignment their race varies, thus all choices 
are possible.

Warriors, Rangers, and Berserkers.
~

#193
-1 FAERIE FAERIES FAERYS~
FAERIE FAERIES
 
Extremely intelligent and extremely fast.  The weakness of the faerie
lies only in their lack of strength and stamina.  Their spellcasting
talents are marred only by their inability to use the spells of faerie fire
and faerie fog which are distrupted by faerie's own magical aura.  For the
same reasons they are also immune to those spells allowing a faerie to 
become quite an accomplished thief.  With their superb dexterity and natural 
flying ability faeries are able to travel the realms with great speed as 
they glide silently through out the areas.  
 
Faeries can be the following classes:
Invoker, Battlemage, Thief, and Bard.

#194
-1 'HALF-ELF' 'HALF-ELVES'~
HALF-ELF HALF-ELVES

Half-elves are brought about by the merging of elven and human blood.
Shunned by those of pure elven heritage, half-elves usually choose to
live among the more tolerating humans.  As a consequence of their mix
blood, they have inherited a sense of curiosity and creativity from
their human ancestors, and a love of nature and appeal for the aesthetics
from their elven blood.  What they lose in strength and stamina, they
make up in intelligence and agility. Half-elves have also retain the
ability to see unaided in the dark and are most resistant to the affect
of charm.  Due to their curiosity, half-elves are also quick to learn
the skills of their trade.

-1 BERSERKER BERSERKERS~
Berserkers are a sect of fighters who focuses more on brute strength and 
the direct approach instead of the complex combat maneuvers of the warriors.  
They are known to have a foul and uncontrollable temper, walking a thin line 
between sanity and insanity.  At times, they are known to be overwhelmed by 
their temper and plunge into a frenzy of rage.  While in this state, a 
berserker is known to inflict massive amount of damage on their opponent as 
well as being able to withstand incredible blows from others.  There are times
when a berserker may be overcome by panic when they cannot see.  During this 
period the berserker may begin to land blows at frantic pace until his panic 
subsides.

At midpoint of their career, the members of this guild choose a focus for 
their deadly rage thus becoming unstoppable juggernauts of fury, or more
controlled zealots able to always calm their deadly anger only to call upon
it once again when it serves them best.

Late in their career they may choose a single weapon type to gain expertise
in, thus becoming more skilled with it then mere common swordsman. Soon after
their choice in Path Focus flowers into frutition and they gain further 
abilities dependant upon their earlier choices.

complex maneuvers of the art of combat.  Due to their training, 
they are the elite fighters of the land.  Warriors have the ability 
to wield every weapon effectively and can learn a wide variety of 
offensive as well as defensive skills to fight an opponent.

The profession of Warriors alone has the unique ability to dedicate
themselfs to particular choice of weapons hence gaining an opportunity
to become experts and masters of a given weapon type.  Through out 
their career warriors are given a choice of two weapon types in which
to become experts, and near peak of their power can further select
one more weapon to bring forth unto mastery becoming unmatched in
their skill.

This choice of weapon expertise and mastery further affects their
avaliable choices when selecting from Warrior Lore late in their 
careers, and allows them to grant mercy to their opponents when battling
with a weapon of which they hold mastery.

the Gods and demons of the netherworld they possess a devastating array

-1 CLERIC CLERICS~
CLERIC CLERICS

The paths of the cleric are many.  Some become healers and devote their
life to preserving peace and harmony within the realms.  Some become
tainted and use their communing gifts to destroy that same harmony.
This is a class strongly divided between good and evil, and there is no
in between.  Those clerics who follow the light may eventually decide to
dedicate themselves solely to the healer mentality later on in life.
On the other side, those who traverse the path of darkness may one day
choose to follow the path of the shaman.

Whatever path you choose, remember one thing.  Clerics are the servants
of the Gods, and that is where their powers stem from.  Thus they, more
than others, are constantly being watched.  To stray from one's path is
to stray from one's God... and the punishment for doing such cannot even
be described in words.  When your experience has grown sufficiently the
appropriate option will be offered to you.  May your choice be the right
one.

  Forsaken Lands includes a comprehensive Justice system used to 
prosecute and punish criminals who break the laws of Abbahran.
(Help Laws).   In a case of WANTED flag being issued, the criminal
is hunted down by members of JUSTICE cabal and apprehended through 
bringing the victim to near-death state. At this point he/she will
be stunned and placed in Jail dictated by JUSTICE member's hometown.

Upon apprehension ALL belongings of the criminal are put inside 
a small container marked with criminal's name, and given to the 
JUSTICE who performed the apprehension. A default sentence (NORMAL)
of 20 hours will be issued by default.  The sentence can further be 
changed using "jail" command to following verdicts:

BAIL, EXTENDED, EXECUTION, RELEASE, TRANSFER.

After serving the set sentence or upon payment of set bail, the 
criminal is set free, and the WANTED status removed.  No additional
penalty of lost experience etc. is enforced with exeception being case
of Execution.

Enjoying Your Stay in Jail Cells:
  
  When the criminal is captured by being stunned through combat with
JUSTICE member or any of their charmed followers, he/she is automaticly
placed in the least populated cell of the jail.  The Cells are warded with
powerfull enchantements which place following restrictions upon the mates.

- No violence of any kind.
- No magic or communing to gods is allowed.
- No transportation through arcane  means (recall, gate, teleport)
- NO QUITTING (Read below for some IMPORTANT notes on dropping link)


While you are enjoying yourself alone or with other inmates of your cell
you will notice the following:

- Upon your arrival your health is automaticly set to 25% and your mental
  powers are drained.
- You will not get hungry nor thirsty.
- You will not enter the "Void" due to inactivity.
- You will not disconnect due to inactivity

Furthermore the exit and entrance to the cell is restricted by a magical
forcefield which will prevent movement of all objects with exception of
JUSTICE members.  JUSTICE members may enter the cells for limited amount
of time, before being forced to leave the area.

 *******************************************************************************
** ACHTUNG: If you drop link while under any verdict in a jail cell, there    **
** is small chance that the executioner will grow angry and automaticly upgrade**
** your sentence to an EXECUTION which are carried out regardless of connection**

JAIL3

So You Want to Escape Alcatraz...

  Each Jail has a JailGuard who's mind serves as a focus for the magical
barriers enclosing the JailCells.  As long as the JailGuard is alive and
well at the entrance of the Jail, the magical barriers will function
and prevent any escape.

  The Jail Guard will automaticly prevent entrance into the Jail by any
unauothrized personnel, and will announce any attack upon its person
to all present JUSTICEs.

**ANY ATTACK UPON JAIL WILL BE PUNISHABLE TO FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW**

  The moment the Jail Guard perishes, the magical barriers will loose 
their focus and allow any prisoners who wish to leave to escape.  Any
sentences still in effect will be canceled on the first hour you spend
outside of a jail cell.  If you choose to remain in your cell when the 
barriers drop, the sentence will be carried out as normal.

**Note that escape from jail would most likely be viewed as a repeated
offense by JUSTICE members.

So in summary:  As long as the JailGuard is present, movement to and from
the Jail and Jailcells is restricted to JUSITCE members only.  Attack
upon those Guards is grounds for immediate prosecution by JUSTICE.

-1 NORMAL BAIL EXTEND EXTENDED EXECUTE EXECUTION RELEASE TRANSFER~
NORMAL, BAIL, EXTEND, EXECUTE, RELEASE TRANSFER
What You May be Sentenced With While in Jail:
NORMAL: Default sentence given upon apprehension, it may be changed
by Justice in charge of criminal to any other verdict.  Upon serving
this sentence the criminal is released free and innocent.
BAIL:  Criminals given BAIL sentence will serve remaning amount of
time from the NORMAL sentence, except in cases when remaning time
was lower then 5 hours.  During the time on BAIL, anyone including
the criminal can pay the bail using "bail" command as follows:
Syntanx: bail           : shows current bail info.
         bail <gold/cp> : pays YOUR bail in gold or cabal points 
         bail <criminal> <gold/cp> : pays given criminal's bail
         
If the criminal does not pay the bail before end of the sentence
the verdict is automaticlly changed to EXTENDED with similiar severity.
Any time already served is applied towards the new sentence.
EXTEND:  This is a fairly serious verdict which results in increased
stay in our beautifull jails by anywhere from 30 to 60 hours based
on JUSTICE's judgement.  Upon serving the sentence the criminal is
released free and innocent.
EXECUTE:  The harshest of punishments reserved for repeat offenders
and enemies of the Law or Crown.  The JUSTICE chooses out of large choice
of various executions and condemns the criminal to death.  It takes 12 
hours for all to be prepared (criminals are advised to spend the time 
with local cleric of One God) during which the future entertainment is 
announced in the area of execution.  This verdict is the only one that 
results in death and loss of experience.
RELEASE:  The criminal is released on following hour free and innocent.
This verdict may NOT be placed after EXECUTION has been announced.
TRANSFER:  Transfers jurisdiction of criminal over to a new JUSTICE
member.  Only JUSTICE with juridiction over the criminal has power
to affect their fate in our glorious jails.

-1 ILLITHID ILLITHIDS~
ILLITHID ILLITHIDS

Illithids are an evil race of subterranean creatures who are endowed with
vast mental abilities.  They possess the intelligence and wisdom to
match almost any other race above or below the surface.  They have been
known to stun foes with a projected cone of force in combat.  In cases of
emergencies, Illithids enter a state of shock, in which their body divert
their mental resources directly into healing for a limited amount of time.
However, they cannot heal either their body or mind for its duration, and
therefore this is used only as a last resort to ward off death.  Due to their
subterranean nature they are vulnerable to light based attacks, while their 
mental prowess and unnatural metabolism grant them resistance to mental and 
lighting based spells and attacks.

Illithids cannot wield weapons, but they can parry using an innate skill.
They have automatic proficiency in several minor spells.

Illithids can be: Necromancer
Commands for Illithids: CONE, LEECH
~

#218
-1 CONE~
CONE OF FORCE
Syntax: cone
Using their innate psionic powers, Illithids can project a cone of force
with their mind alone.  The force will cause moderate damage to everyone
in the attack range of the Illithid, stunning them in the process.  Though
this requires a lot of mental effort on I part, so the Illithid can only use 
this command once per day.
~

#219
-1 LEECH~
LEECH

Illithids have gained a special skill, in which they wrap their tentacles
around the victim's head, and run an electric current through their
tentacles, penetrating the skull.  Specialized sensors at the tips of the
tentacles reads the feedback of the electric currents, and if successful
they are able to steal the victim's memory temporarily.  The memory is not
lost from the victim.  However, the shock to the head have a chance of
causing disorientation to the victim. With this skill, Illithids can gain
temporary proficiency of spells from illusionists, invokers, necromancers,
and psionicists.  Due to the enormous strain it takes to retain the memory,
the Illithid will be drained for a short while after the affects have worn
off.  Only the more experienced Illithids can use this skill.

-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~
MINOTAUR MINOTAURS

Minotaurs are man-like creatures with the upper torso and the foul temper
of bulls.  Although they are strong and tough, their unstable temperament
tends to cloud their thinking and judgment.  As with many beasts, they have
no true goodness or villainy in them, and thus can only walk the path of
Balance. They naturally have chaotic tendencies as well.  In addition,
minotaur berserkers make use of their horns while charging at their opponents 
for additional damage.

As an innate ability of their race, minotaurs are proficient in the use of
axes, and can dual wield any two axes without penalty.  They are also easily
consumed by rage while engaged in combat.  Only the warrior and berserker 
guild will allow minotaurs to join their ranks.

against these unnatural creatures were blessed with extraordinary abilities
by the gods of Nature.

-1 SLITH SLITHS~
SLITH SLITHS
 
A race of sentient lizard men, sliths make their living as mercenaries to
others, or adventurers in their own right.  Although they lack the brute
strength of many others in the warrior profession, they are quick and
agileon their feet.  They also gain an additional attack in combat, by
quickly turning to strike or trip with their long tails.  This attack is
automatic, and gains strength as the slith becomes more experienced.  Able
to shed their skin as a decoy when they need to flee from their foes they
can become very defensible if needed.  Since Sliths are cold blooded, they
are not visible on the infrared spectrum as well as see with infravision. 
However despite these common traits, there exists three distinct species of
slith, each possessing their own moral views and alignment.  
 
Evil, or Red Sliths possess a second set of eyelids which allow them to
protect their eyes from kicked dirt.
 
Neutral, or Green Sliths, like snakes and other reptiles, can unhinge their
jaws to swallow corpses whole as a means of nourishment.
 
Good, or Blue Sliths, possess controlable pigmentation within their skin,
allowing them to alter their color, and remain unseen for short periods of
time.
 
Sliths can only join the warrior or thief guild.  Having no ties to others
of their kind, they have a great deal of choice in their ethos and align.
Because they are creatures of the wilderness, they have natural proficiency
in the use of spears.
 
Avaliable classes: Warrior, Thief and Blademaster.

Gnomes are a race of small creatures living in the woodlands of Aabahran,
or venturing underground in their burrows.  Having roughly human 
proportions, they are a peaceful lot, and many amuse themselves by 
dabbling in magic.  Because of their peaceful nature, they have found 
great knowledge in the ways of the world, and are the wisest of all 
Aabahran's races.  Gnomes are a contemplative lot, thinking of this and
that, and due to their daydreaming nature, they are vulnerable to the two
types of attacks that assault the mind, Charm spells and Mental spells.
 
Gnomes can be the following classes:
Bard, Warrior, Ranger, Thief, Invoker, Battlemage, and Blademaster.

#234
-1 HERALD~
HERALD
 
Millenia ago, during the first War of the Legions, there existed a formal
guild of explorers with a thirst of knowledge so intense, that they would
venture into unknown and hostile territory to sate that thirst for but a
single moment.  But as war often does, this guild, known as Herald, was put
to use in combat.  Acting upon orders of the High King of Aabahran, the guild
of Herald were commissioned as Military Advisors, using their knowledge of
the lands to aid in the war.
 
For the duration of the War, Herald stood beside the King and his court
of advisors, dispensing information that had taken ages to acquire.  Local
myths, legends, rumors...  The King wanted to know everything that would
be of use.  Libraries were emptied, their tomes and scriptures brought
before the King to be perused at his leisure, and in the fray, much was
lost.  They had become little more than a tool.  And as history has shown,
tools that have lost their usefullness, are often thrown away.
 
When the War of the Legions finally subsided, the Heralds were of no more
practical use, and were decommissioned; sent back to the dusty libraries
from whence they came.  But the guild remained.  They sat in the background
and watched idly as the Kingdom collapsed.  They watched as the King was
slain, and all that he surveyed plunged into Chaos.  With the King's death,
their tie to the Kingdom was severed, and they became autonomous, answering
to no one but themselves.  And thus began a period of renewal.
 
Since the dark days of the first War of the Legions, the Heralds have
spared no expense at the acquisition of knowledge.  They are in possession
of the single most expansive library in Aabahran, overshadowing even that of
the Tower of Savant's.  Little passes by the scrutinous eye of a Herald, and
the eyes of Herald are many.

-1 MORP MPROG OPROG RPROG~
Introduction:

  MORPs or Mob Obj Room Program is a script language utilized to give life
and reactive ability to various parts of the MUD environment.  Each type 
of morp exists on a separate set of vnums (HELP VNUM) much like objects,
rooms and mobs do.  

Each type of morp can be attached to corresponding type of environment
(object/mob/room) and easily reused.  For example a particular mprog can
be assigned to any number of mobs, with each mob responding in the same
manner when the mprog is activated.

Activation of the morps is dictated by a "trigger type" of the morp which
is set when a specific morp is assigned to a mobile.  Multiple instances
of same morp can be assigned to same mob with various triggers, resulting
in the morp being activated in various situations.

Following is a list of various helps relating to MORPs.

1)  HELP MORP2............Creation, and Editing of morps
2)  HELP ADD, DEL.........Attaching and Deleting morps to/from environment
3)  HELP TRIGGER..........Morp Trigger reference
4)  HELP SCRIPT...........Writing Morp Scripts

HELP MORP2
note: <required argument> [optional argument]

Creation and Editing of Morps.

Creation:
syntax: edit <mprog/rprog/oprog> create <vnum>
             Above creates a morp with given vnum, and places 
             the user into morp edit mode.
Editing:
        edit <mprog/rprog/oprog> <vnum>
             Above edits a given morp and places user into morp edit mode.
  
Once in morp edit mode:
syntax: code          enters standard OLC editor for the morp script
        list          lists all mprog/rprog/oprogs in the area.

Any changes to a morp are automatically updated throughout the mud.
~

#237
-1 HELP ADD DEL~
note: <required argument> [optional argument]

Once a morp is created, and its script written and entered, it has
to be attached to a given mob/room/object and its trigger specified.
To attach a morp to its corresponding object (oprogs to obj, mprogs 
to mobs etc.) use:

Syntax:   add [vnum] [trigger] [phrase]
           
          vnum:    vnum of the morp to be attached
          trigger: trigger type for the morp (HELP TRIGGER for reference,
                   ? rprog/mprog/oprog for list of available triggers)
          phrase:  argument for the trigger (HELP TRIGGER)

Once a morp is attached, all objects/mobs/rooms are updated with that
morp.  Use mpstat, rpstat, opstat to selectively query the details of 
specific mob/object/room.

To remove a morp use:

Syntax: del <number of morp to remove>
        removes the given morp on the list shown in mob edit.
        
examples:
         add 3000 GRALL 100
         add 3000 SPEECH quest
         del 0

#238
-1 TRIGGER TRIGGERS~
TRIGGERS

Following is a list of trigger and their argument/phrases.  Keep in mind
not all types of morps support all of those.  Use ? <mprog/oprog/rprog>
for exact list of supported triggers when editing an object/room/mob.

"OWNER" refers to the mob/obj/room that has the trigger assigned to it.
"ACTOR" refers to the mob/obj/room that set off the trigger.

#263
-1 SCRIPT SCRIPTS~
Script commands:
  These are commands mostly used in the if-else-endif blocks to direct the
flow of the morp as well as make logical decisions.  The syntax for use of
the if-else-endif block is as follows:

if condition
  command/s evaluated if TRUE
else
  commands/s evaluated if FALSE
endif

Since the "else" statement is not required, the simple if-endif block 
is as follows:

if condition
  command/s evaluated if TRUE
endif


Break command:
  The break keyword will cause the morp to abort and stop when it is encountered.
  It is useful in controlling the flow of the program especial in conjunction with
  if-else-endif blocks.  Example:

if rand 30
  mob echo TRUE
else
  break
endif
mob echo This is not shown unless preceded by TRUE.

CHAMELEON
Syntax: chameleon

  Members of the slith race, due to their lizard heritage have
a particular ability to control the pigment of their outer skin
and with great effort perfectly camouflage themselfs in any spot
much like a chameleon.  Due to the fact that any slight movement
tends to destroy the illusion and it requires immense concentration
on the part of the slith, this ability is oft used as a last resort.

any shields their opponents may be wearing sending their victim's 
standing spells and teeth flying in shambles.

BLOODHAZE
Syntax:	automatic

  Submerged in murky depths of insanity with a red veil over their eyes, 
the followers of the path of devastation will occasionly ignore blows and
spells that would fry a lesser man to cinders, or hew him apart.  Instead
these madman only roar in pain and continue on their unstoppable rampage
of insanity.

PATH FOCUS

  As the berserker comes to power in his or her guild, they are required to
choose a path of focus for their deadly arts of rage and further hone their
anger towards a certain style.  Three paths are avaliable, and unless chosen,
the berserker will remain only capable of producing the bland, unfocused
rage he has used since his birth.  The following paths are possible:

	path of anger
	path of fury
	path of devastation

-2 berserker~ 'PATH OF ANGER'~
PATH OF ANGER
Syntax:	automatic

  Those of the berserker guild whom prefer to control the deadly tide within
their mind choose this path to futher learn and practice various techniques
for relaxation and mental focus.  They become capable of always relaxing
out of their raged state even while in combat, and take far less time for
this task then others of their guild.  Later in their career their mental
training and perseverance pays off as they glean advanced techinques of using
haymaker to their advantage.

  Since the memebers of the path of anger always strive to control their anger,
their rage is generaly weaker.

#297
-2 berserker~ 'PATH OF FURY'~
PATH OF FURY
Syntax:	automatic

  Riding the edge between deadly tide of madness and weaker state of anger,
those whom choose moderation and balance.  Their rage is more powerful then
normal, and significantly stronger then one prefered by followers of path of
anger.  Yet they may not relax in combat, even if their stronger anger does
lend itsself to handling two handed weapons.  Followers of this path are 
capable of more effective weapon block, as they channel their rage and fury
into their grasp on the weapon.  Late in their career they further improve
this ability and glean secrets of powergrip.

  Using their anger in moderation, the followers of this path tend to rage
to a state more powerful then unfocused rage, but no where near the state
followers of path of devastation enter.

PATH OF DEVASTATION
Syntax:	automatic

  The followers of this path (if they can be called that) are often little
more then madman whom bring their minds into the darkest pits of fury and
pain to achive a state of temporary insanity.  The blows they strike are
capable of crumbling hardneded steel and they seem to ignore even most
grevious wounds.  Late in their careers these furious madman begin to 
occasionly ignore wounds that would cause a lesser man to fall mindless with
pain.  Needless to say skills of relaxation are useless to those whom
prefer this path.

-1 'SOUL TRANSFER'~
SOUL TRANSFER
Syntax: cast 'soul transfer' <obj>

  After centuries of using their malformed weapons the guild of Dark Knights
devised this spell to allow transference of power from a malformed weapon
into yet untouched one.  When cast upon an object the spell will form an
unholy channel from a held malformed weapon, and transfer the souls trapped
by the vile device into the targetted weapon.  Thus the new weapon shall
recive the malformed spirit, and contain all the powers, and abilities of its
previous host, albeit at cost to its power as the transfer is not perfect.

BACKCUTTER
Syntax: automatic

  This particular techinque was originaly developed by members of the Warrior
guild whom have held mastery of the nimble and quick staffs.  As their victims
would turn to flee the battle, the warrior would use their primary weapon to 
land a quick blow upon their open back causing great damage.  The skill was soon 
adapted by others but to this day only those holding mastery of spear or staff 
may learn it.

POWER GRIP
Syntax: automatic

  After dedicating years of their life to massive, long hafted weapons 
such as axes and polearms, some warriors develop such powerful grasp when 
using these weapons, that their double grip skill is greatly enhanced.  
Furthermore, if someone does manage to disarm them while they wield such 
weapons, they will manage to still hang on to it partially and drop it 
into their inventory rather then the ground.  The only exception to this 
is the skill of weapon seize when used with exotic weapons.  Curiously 
enough, those warriors whom hold mastery of the nimble and light staffs
have also been known to learn this skill.

WEAPON SEIZE
Syntax:	automatic

  Warriors whom have mastered the use of less common weapons such as
exotics or whips automaticly use this technique when disarming an opponent.
On success the opponent's weapon is whisked out of their grasp, and instead
of falling upon the ground, or to their inventory it is seized by the warrior.
Warriors whom have mastered the use of exotic weapons, have such finess with
these strange weapons, that even weapons which normaly cannot be dropped will
be seized when disarmed.

-2 warrior~ 'SHIELD BASH'~
SHIELD BASH
Syntax: shieldbash

  Often liked by warriors more used to a shield then secondary weapon, the
skill allows the user to charge at the enemy, and use their shield to bash
them with great force.  Unlike bash or bodyslam however the object is to
cause damage with sheer kinetic force, and such shield bash often results
in crushed wrists, arms and weapons flung out of their owner's grasp.

FOCUSED BASH
Syntax: focusedbash
	focusedbash <target>

  Warriors who have dedicated their training to the mastery of the mace may
attempt to land a potent blow aimed at the helm or head of their victims.
When landed with a great enough force, and aimed correctly this blow will
stun and confuze the target, hampering his sense of movement and direction.

MANTIS MAUL
Syntax:	maul 
	maul <target>

  Those warriors whom have spent their life mastering intricacies of using
flails have developed a way to use the difficulty of blocking those weapons
to their advantage.  Using a flail the warrior begins to land a multitude 
of weak blows all about the opponent, concentrating on such vulnerable spots
as face, head and joints.  The final effect of a successful attempt is not
only grievous damage, but often the victim will be overcome by the pain and
the staggering blows will stun or paralyze them for a short while.

FEIGN
Syntax:	feign

  Those of the warrior guild whom have long focused on use of nimble weapons
such as swords and daggers have developed this skill to further gain advantage
over their untrained foes.  When armed with two weapons, the warrior will feign
an attack with his secondary weapon, creating a diversion that when successful
hampers the victim's defenses against the warrior's primary attacks.  Hence
for the round following the feign the warrior's aim and penetration with the
primary attacks will be greatly boosted resulting in guaranteed hits at the 
cost of one of the secondary attacks.

WEAPON LOCK
Syntax:	weaponlock

  Those warriors who tend to focus on more exotic weapons are capable of
using their unusual abilities to deflect, lock, or otherwise disable their 
opponents weaker arm carrying secondary weapons, or shields.  When successfuly
used the opponent's secondary arm becomes useless forfeiting any attacks, 
hampering ability to flee and negating following defenses: dual parry, second 
parry, shield block, weapon block.

-1 MERCY~
MERCY
Syntax:	mercy

A legendary warrior once gave an elegant demonstration of his physical mastery.
Caging a pomegranate in one fist, he invited the onlookers to pry it from his 
hand. For the length of an hour, six strong and able men writhed in a cluster 
at the end of his arm, their combined sixty fingers unable to budge a single 
one of the hero's five.

While this clearly illustrated the warrior's mastery of strength, the most 
poignant part of the demonstration was when he carefully peeled back the 
rind of the fruit, and revealed that not a single ruby seed had been broken.

difficult to disarm, and gives off no indication of being tripped.

a blunt object of thieve's choice.  Its is crude, and hence always visible
and a toddler can disarm it with ease.

POISON NEEDLE

  There are those who belive that in simplicity lies beauty, and whoever
designed this trap seemed to have belived that phrase.  The trap is very small
often composed of single tiny needle coated with deadly poison, or in more
complicated versions of a spring launched dart contained in tiny vial of 
poison.  Both kinds are made to be fitted onto objects.

ENFEEBLER

A devious trap composed of magical spells and mechanical triggers. When setup
the maker may link its function with himself, thus being able to know when
it is activated.  When this occurs the trap creates a field of magical force
that drains the victim's stamina and passes it onto the owner of the trap.
It cannot be dodged, but it is magical in nature.

-2 thief~ 'SNARES'~
SNARES

  This collection of traps includes mechanical traps that are meant to
cause great deal of damage the old fashioned way.  Their design is not
subtle and they tend to be easly spotted, but rather hard to disarm without
getting hurt.

Jagged Snare
  Composed of wrought iron, often with large rusty teeth and a thick chain.  
Perfect for catching bears, ogres, humans and other such prey.

Silver Snare
  Made from a net of silver strands with barbed, jagged edges.  When sprung
the nets rise forth slicing and shredding the victim.  Excellent where
keeping the victim's looks in good condition is not a priority.

Bramble Snare
  The snare of choice in woods and forests, its wooden compositon and thorny
jaws are hard to spot in such terrain.  When sprung the thorns are easy capable
or piercing steel and even enchanted armor.

RUNES

  Runes are traps made not of wood or metal but of spells woven and cast into
runes that may be attatched or drawn upon any surface.  Often placed on doors
or paths they are almost exclusively damage orientated and always magical.

Blue Rune
  Forged with powers of cold and ice, the rune is perfect for catching supper
in early morning, or to shatter frozen limbs of those who trespass on your 
tower.

White Rune
  Stolen in years long gone, this rune's origin has been a source of ongoing
conflict between the Thief and Cleric guild.  When sprung it uses a self
contained prayer coupled with magical boosters to blast the victim with
forces of holy seremons.

Green Rune
  First used as a prank by one of the students on their duergar Guild Master,
this rune uses a self contained spell to instantenously and temporarly change
its proximity into water, and hurl it at the victim with suprising force.
Ingenius in its ability to wash away the blood and gore of its victim, its
rather liked and favored by noble Houses of Miruvhor.

EYEDUSTER
  
  Composed of a small packet of rare salts from beyond Dune Sea then
hidden with spells, this trap when sprung hurls the caustic salts
and then guides them with spells right under the victim's eyelids. Masks,
helms, veil, and even gnome goggles are useless as defense against the
enchanted powders.  The unfortunate victim of this fairly difficult
to disarm trap may be left sightless for hours at end. As an added bonus 
the enchantments used on salts notify the creator when this trap is sprung
or defused.

ANTIMAGIC

 A trap as ancient as the oldest profession of the Aabahran, it was developed
just as the guild of Mages was established.  Composed of a scroll of antimagic,
and a small spell to magicly recite it this trap when sprung attempts to dispel
any enchantements present on its victim.  Since the spell is incaned by the
trap's magic mouth spell, it cannot be dodged.  Like all other traps in the
Magical Trap category, it will notify the user when sprung or defused.

AMNESIA CHARM

  First said to be used by a thief in an attempt to convince a certain
stubborn barmaid that she is his wife. This trap uses a set of poweful 
magical spells to befuddle and confuse its victim's memories.  As an
added improvement it also attempts to isolate the person from any of 
their friends or followers leaving the victim at the mercy of the thief.
Small compact and able to be layered onto nearly anything it is vocal
in nature and cannot be dodge.

-2 thief~ 'BLACKSPORE'~
BLACKSPORE

  While the Thief Guild rarely passes moral judgement, no other device in 
its long history has created more controversy and spilled blood over attempts
to cull and ban its use.

  Wraith Blood, Virigoth's Seed, Death's Touch or more commonly blackspore is
a near invisible spore of an exteremly rare fungus. While it is occasionly
found in dark, evil forests devoid of sunlight, it is almost always present
near shores of the Isle of Souls, and harvested by daring thieves, or healers
who dedicate their lives to destroying this vile fungus.

  Normaly dormant and often carried on the wind, or objects small and large
it almost instantenously matures when in near proximity of any living thing.
Then a slight motion or a gust of wind sets it off releasing the most foul
and potent plagues known to mortals.  Whole villages are said to be wiped
clean by this vile mushroom, and far more thieves have died to it then
have used it successfuly.

-2 thief~ CHESTBUSTER~
CHESTBUSTER

  A recent invention by one of the members of the Thief guild, this
trap is a marvelous blend of magical and mechanical components.  Fused
into a tiny metalic container filled with shredded old armor is a minature
spell of air pocket.  The round container itself is either set with
spell of invisibility when placed on small or large objects, or with
spell of flight when set on exits.  When tripped the container flies
forth towards its victim, guided by its magic to penetrate deep into
the flesh near lungs or stomach.  Then the spell of air pocket activates
not only hopefully exploding the victim's chest but also riddling the
poor sod and anyone in close vicinity with splendid fountain of blood, 
gore and the metal junk within the container.

The trap was a wild hit with the thieves everywhere and stories of
"suprise birthdays" and "smashing dinners" cut short by the gore
of the victim's chest exploding are a common talk in the guild.

-2 thief~ 'DEVIL WHEEL'~
DEVIL WHEEL

  Shown to select members of the Thief Guild, the Devil Wheel is a an enigma
of questionable use or purpose.

  Designed by the Master Assassin Zenizen at the height of his demonic 
possesion, the contraption is composed of a hundred or more tiny parts
dispersed around the area and all but invisible to an untrained eye.
When triggered, these tiny grain sized parts seem to come together as if
by magic, (yet no spells have been detected on the trap by even the most 
skilled Psionicists) and form what appears to be a giant pentagram about
the victim.

The mechanism, spent as it was while Zenizen was still alive, seems to do
nothing now except that, leaving its effect a mystery unsolved.

-1 'THIEF TRAPS'~
THIEF TRAPS
Syntax:	trap <trap> <object>	:set the given trap on an object
	trap <trap> <exit>	:set the given trap on an exit/door

  The Hallmark skill of the Master Thieves, this particular discipline
allows the user to construct and set various little ingenious devices aimed
usually towards maiming, killing, or otherwise disabling whoever happens
to set the little devil off.

  While the specific selection of traps to use varies due to specialization 
within the thief guild, each trap has some common general properties such 
as its duration, and if it can be set upon [E]xits/doors, [O]bjects, or [S]mall
objects.  Traps set on Exits are tripped when the door is opened, or someone 
steps through the exit.  Those set on objects are tripped when the object is 
picked up, or used in anyway (opening a chest for example).  Only traps 
designed to be Small, can be set up onto objects that may be picked up.

  The traps respect the PK range, and cannot be seen, defused, or tipped by
those whom the thief cannot harm including themselfs.  Most traps are 
destroyed when tripped or defused, but will exist untill their duration
expires, or their owner leaves the lands.

A thief may at any time have maximum of two active traps.  If a third tap is made
the oldest trap in existance will fall apart.

-1 PLANT~
PLANT
Syntax:	plant <item>		:attempts to plant or swap an item
 	plant <item> sec	:attempts to plant item into its secondary spot
	plant <item> <for item> :swaps an item for the second item

A rather devious albeit limited ability, the plant skill allows the
thief to directly trade or plant items on their victim's body.
If two objects are specified then an attempt is made to trade them
for eachother without the victim even noticing.  If only one
object is specified an attempt is made to put it on victim's body.

When an object is being swapped, the difference in their weights has large
bearing on your chances of success.  If the weights are close enough, it
is almost impossible to fail, hence skilled thiefs often leave their
victims in rags, rather naked while they walk away loaded with loot.

~

#331
-1 APPROACH~
APPROACH
Syntax: approach <victim>	:approaches the future donor of goods

  In order for a theif to pry or plant items from their chosen donor's 
selection, they must approach their victim first.  Then they may proceed
to pry or plant items, with each attempt contributing to bringing the victim
closer to the waking world.  The rank of the thief has a large bearing on how
'light' their touch is, hence a master thief may afford himself more failures
or steal more items then his lower ranked counterpart.

See also: PRY, PLANT
~

#332
-1 PRY~
PRY
Syntax: pry <weight> <object>	:pry the object while guessing its weight
Weight: weightless		:object weights nothing or next to nothing
	light			:a light object, even a faerie can lift it
	medium			:a weight of an average human weapon or armor
	heavy			:very heavy, examples include platinum or red dragon armors


  The second defining skill of thieves, the ability to pry allows a skilled
thief to literally steal a shirt from their victim's back.  In order to attempt
this risky procedure, the thief must approach its victim first.  Once in
near proximity of it victim, the thief may pry items off the person's body
by first judging the weight as to apply the proper amount of force and
finesse.

Thus, the <weight> is one's judgement of how heavy the item is, while <object>
is the item in question.  The thief then begins the careful maneuver of
attempting to remove the item and put it in their inventory where it belongs.
A guess not close enough to the true weight of the object will hamper the
chances to the point of failure, while giving considerable bonus for close
guesses.

DOUBLESHEATH
Syntax:	sheath <obj>	: double sheathes

weapons on their bodies, either in regular sheathes or other compartments.
Those skilled in doublesheath may thus place a weapon aside while they hold

automaticly if the corresponding wielded weapon is lost, regardless of 
circumstance.  Doublesheathed weapons may also be switched or rotated on 
command with 'draw' command.

NOTE:  A thief or ninja well versed in skill of throwing can hide their
daggers or shurikens in one of the sheaths, and automaticly throw them 
when about to murder their victim, or when their mark flees from battle.

The art of voodoo is one practiced by high-level shamans.  The shaman 
uses black magic to bring harm to their enemies over great distances.

To first bring harm to an enemy, the shaman must first make a voodoo doll.  
To do so, the shaman must choose a target.  Once the target is found, they 
must create a doll by using the following syntax:  voodoo create <target>.

USING A VOODOO DOLL
After a voodoo doll is made of the target, the shaman may then use it to 
bring harm to their target.  The shaman may bring weaken, curse, plague, 
poison, hex, harm, insomnia, blindness, and enfeeblement onto the victim.  
To place such a burden, use the following syntax: 
voodoo place <target> <spell>.

a Dark Knight may attempt to cast the most vile of spells upon his weapon. 
It is rumored that when successful this evil enchantment calls the attention 
of the evil gods of Aabahran, thus breathing malicious spirit into the target item. 
From then on as the Dark Knight kills with the object, the spirit within will 
feed on each corpse it creates passing the souls it consumes on to its master 
deity. When enough of such dark gifts are received the deity often blesses the 
Dark Knight by further increasing the spirits abilities. Yet until the 
intelligence has grown strong enough, it will slowly weaken if not on its 
master's person as it slowly bleeds dark powers. 

While it is written in ancient scripts that the most powerful of these dark 
tools have made their owner's all but gods, the exact details of the spells 
requirements have been lost in the chaos following Shadowspawns arrival.

-1 'DOUBLE GRIP'~
DOUBLE GRIP
Syntax: double
Syntax: double <weapon>

Many professions have the ability to wield weapons using both hands.  
Warriors however, in their endeavor to develop differing techniques
stumbled upon the advantage of using only one weapon.  Grasping a weapon
with both hands allows a warrior to use the weapon with greater stability, 
obtaining greater control.  While double gripping a weapon, a warrior would 
be able to do more damage than he/she would using only one hand while making 
them harder to disarm.  Due to the nature of this technique only certain 
types of weapon may be gripped with two hands.  Staffs and polearms which 
already require the use of both hands can still apply this technique to gain 
greater stability.  Using double grip without a syntax will double grip the 
weapon you are wielding.  Double with a name and you'll wield the weapon from 
your inventory to wield and doublegrip. 

Note that while double gripping a weapon you still require the "two handed"
skill to control your weapon efficiently.

DRUNKEN STANCE
Syntax: drunken

The drunken stance symbolizes the spontaneous movement and elusiveness 
of a drunk.  The monk staggers around unpredictably, making it more 
difficult to connect a blow to the monk.  The monk will be affected by 
all affects of being drunk.  Heavy equipment will weight the monk down, 
preventing the monk from moving freely. In order to move as a drunk, a 
monk must empower their defenses.

-1 CATALEPSY~
CATALEPSY
Syntax: catalepsy

Monks are skilled enough to control their body.  Thus, they are able to
lower their body temperature and heart rate, causing self induced
catalepsy.  In this form, they appear to be dead, looking exactly like a
corpse, fooling their opponents.  However, they can still be attacked, and 
the mana upkeep is required.  In this state, monks do not know what is going 
on around them.  To appear dead, a monk must be defensive. To return back to 
normal, monks use the REVIVE command.

-1 EMPOWER EMPOWERMENT~
syntax: empower offense, empower defense

In order to use their more advanced skills, monks will have to prepare
themselves specifically for their tasks.  This process is known as
empowerment.  Monks can only choose to empower either offensively or 
defensively, not both.  An offensively empowered monk will be able
to use such skills as air thrash, while a defensively empowered monk
gains access to more advanced defenses like second parry and balance.

-1 'MONKEY STANCE' MONKEY~
MONKEY STANCE
Syntax: monkey

The monkey stance symbolizes the agility and speed of the monkey.  While 
in this stance, it allows the monk to move twice as quickly during battle.  
But because they only have half the time to prepare, each attack only 
does a little more than half the normal damage.  While moving quickly, 
monks must consume lots of food and water.  Heavy equipment hinders the 
agility of the monkey.  To be as the monkey, a monk must be in the 
offensive.

-1 'BUDDHA STANCE' BUDDHA~
BUDDHA STANCE
Syntax: buddha

The Buddha stance symbolizes the peace and tranquility of the Buddha's 
philosophies.  The Buddha stance allows the monk to take full control of 
his mind, resisting all harmful spells cast against the monk. This stance 
requires that no heavy equipment is worn on the head to distract the 
concentration of the monk.  To be one with the Buddha, a monk must first 
empower his defenses.

-1 'DRAGON STANCE' DRAGON~
DRAGON STANCE
Syntax: dragon

The dragon stance symbolizes the magnificence and longevity of the dragon.  
Filled with the spirit of the dragon, the monk will increase in size, and 
embody the health of the dragon.  The monk can also disarm easier while in 
the dragon stance.  Most equipment hinders the growth of the monk.  To be 
as a dragon, a monk must first empower their offenses.

#702
-1 STANCE~
'STANCE'

In conjunction with mental and physical training, a skilled monk learns the 
fighting styles and attributes of many.  The monk then focuses their mind and 
mimics that style with great accuracy.  The monk must assume that stance, to 
properly fight like what they seek to mimic.  Since the different stances they 
may learn do different things, they must either empower offensive or defensive 
to successfully do a certain stance.  Some attacks and/or effects are unique
to the particular stance.

-1 'ORDER OF CRUSADES'~
ORDER OF CRUSADES

BEGINNINGS
  The Order of Crusades was first founded in the 5th age of Aabahran by a 
single hermit of name Ontius.  The land was beset by evil, and seeing the 
forces of Light slowly dwindling the wizened hermit journeyed forth and 
gather a few men and women of blade about him, only to teach them the ways 
of the One God.  

HISTORY
  The Order, first based out of an old church with leaky roof set deep within
the Dragon Teeth, was first joined by Auron, Tyrith, Elyventheril, Barzuke as 
well as Garamand and Versutius.  Following the teachings of Ontius they rose 
in power and soon reached their pinnacles.  With their rise in strength the 
Order slowly expanded as the old church was slowly being converted into a 
mighty fortress it is now.

The key event that established the Order of Crusades existence and foot hold 
against the darkness of the land, was the raid of the Order against the 
fortress of the Hooded Ones, in which Auron, Garamand and Versutius led the 
soldiers of the Order of Crusades into a complete victory resulting in  the 
destruction of cabal known as Conclave which forever banished the secret cult.

Ever since the Order of Crusades has stood vigilant and strong against any 
sight of evil in the land.  Sending its valiant men and women to aid those in 
need, and to fight the evil.

MISSION
The Order of Crusades with its mission set upon by Ontius the Hermit seeks to
help the land and forces of light not by militant ways, but by sheer power of
acts of goodness and sacrfice performed by its members.
The virtues of Kindness, Modesty, Honor and Sacrifice are ever the foremost in 
its members, and they are expected to act as priests and healers before 
warriors and to answer any call for help regardless of circumstance.

CRUSADER

  Trained by the Order of Crusades these mighty men and women of the
One God, travel through Aabahran helping those in need, avenging
wrongs done, and Crusading against those whom would seek to harm the less
fortunate.  Honor, Valor and above all Modesty are their virtues,
requiring a Crusader to act as priests first then warriors, without the
easy miracles of common deities.

  Crusaders are warriors who have chosen to use Faith as the focus for their
skills, at times honing them to such degree that their feats all but
surpass the mortal realm.  As they progress through ranks they are offered
choices in skills, these choices in turn affecting what other skills they
will have available in future.  The end result of this process is that no
two Crusaders are alike, as the choices they make often drastically affect
the things they may excel or do poorly in.

  Rejecting delicate and non direct methods of combat, they relay upon brutal
combination of skill and strength combined with legendary arts of weaponcraft 
and armorcraft which allows them to excel in combat against single or multiple
opponents.  Experts of two handed weapons, they never use shields relying
instead on armors so thick and heavy that legends have been sung about
their ability to wade through battle unharmed by blows of ordinary blades.
They carry weapons consecrated to their god which increase in power as the
Crusader fulfills his duties to the Order.  These holy weapons seem to 
withstand the most brutal of modifications and many a foe has been brought
to his knees by a mere sight of a blade bristling with gleaming edges, barbs
and hooked guards leveled at their chest.

  The Crusader's focus upon the matters of faith and their virtues of Modesty,
Compassion and Valour not only requires them to forsake personal goals when
asked for help by those in need, but the Order of Crusades forbids them to
bask in large number of rare or unique adornments upon their armor.  This 
severely limits the number of such items they may wear or carry.

  Foreseeing great trails and dangers ahead of them, the Order of Crusades
commissioned the dwarven Master Smiths to construct number of stone markers
throughout the land.  Upon these obelisks were then inscribed the Order's
teachings, and secrets to keep their knowledge forever safe.

To safeguard the history, philosophy as well as secrets of the Order, the
inscriptions were scribed in form of Psalms, which worthy Crusaders would
commit to memory to be chanted when needed.

PSALMS
syntax: psalms		: shows list of memorized psalms

  Scattered through the lands are the Obelisks created by the Order of
Crusades.  Each one holds a holy psalm upon its surface, which can
be memorized by using the Obelisk.  The Obelisks were created by the
dwarven Master Smiths, and are imbued with powerful magics that not
only protect them, but also cause many of them to shift to various
locations with time.

A Crusader who has found such an Obelisk, may memorize the Psalm which
has been inscribed upon the stone by "using" it at which point its 
inscription may be recalled at any time using the "help" command.  
Only a limited number of Psalms may be memorized in a lifetime, slowly 
increasing in number up to maximum of eight at peak of Crusader's power.

A single special Psalm exists upon the Obelisk of Baptism which when
chanted, will wipe the Crusaders memory of Psalms clean at the same
time forever lowering the maximum number that may be memorized by one.

  The Order of Crusades' focus on spiritual health and its goals of
independence have resulted in Crusaders being taught the ancient art
of chants and lore of Psalms.

A Crusader may chant a memorized psalm, using it to focus their mind 
and body to the point where their abilities begin to surpass the mundane.
The concentration involved is enormous, and when a chant begins, the
Crusader will not be able to do anything but meditate and chant.

Only a single Psalm may be held in one's mind at any given time and
only death or natural expiration will remove them.

-1 STARSTONE STARSTONES~
STARSTONES

Fulfilling their goal of independence and self-sustenance the Order of
Crusades made great efforts to gather every tome, scripture and rumors
that could further benefit their already advanced metallurgic techniques.
One of such ancient tomes led to discovery of a wondrous mineral called
Starstone, which oft could be found amidst giant craters in the land
as if the earth was trying to expel the strange stone.

The stone maybe found scattered through the lands in various locations
in form of slabs of starstone often burnt and scarred but never shattered.
It's properties are many, and most wondrous or almost magical in nature.
The stone has almost no weight, yet a slight momentum results in impetus
worthy of lead or gold, it resists extreme stress and shear and is all
but impervious to non magical fires.

With cooperation of the dwarven Master Smiths in trade for the secrets
of this stone, the Order of Crusades has developed unique ways of working
the starstones and guards its properties with dangerous secrecy.

Using the sheer kinetic force of their heavy armors and body, the

the likes of bash or bodyslam however, the objective is to cause brutal

enemies rather then cause damage, they are more the capable of sending the 
most stalwart foes to their knees through sheer kinetic force.  Charging so 
into the fray, their armor absorbing the blows, the Crusader swings his 
massive weapon about knocking his foes down as if they were mere practice

  The Order of Crusades' focus on independence and self-reliance in face of
any odd and its stress on virtue of Modesty caused the Order to begin 
schooling their members in disciplines of armor and weapon craft soon after
the Order's Conception.  With the discovery of the scripts which led to the
Order's use of Starstone, the positions of Master Armorer and Smith have been
one of the most prestigious within the Order.

A Crusader may use "modify" command to attempt to modify weapon or armor and
increase their abilities.  For a list of possible modifications to an object
use "modify <object>" command.

Every modification has a minimum skill level of common, journeyman, expert 
or master, which unless met causes the modification to not be displayed.
Various skills such as "history of armaments" or "arms maintenance" increase
the level of skill in armorcraft or weaponcraft thus allowing more complex
modifications.  For specific information on particular modification use 
"modify help <name>".

HOLY WEAPON
syntax: automatic with use of "modify <weapon> consecration"

  A Crusader must consecrate their weapon before any of the more powerful
modifications may be placed upon it.  The ritual of consecration places
powerful blessings upon the weapon, from then on turning it into a tool
of divine retribution.

When such weapon is used to strike down a player of race or guild whom 
the Crusader has called a Crusade against, or someone whom Crusader has 
killed when acting as an avenger.  The holy weapon will grow in its 
benevolence, further increasing in power and reflecting the Crusaders 
performance along the teachings of the Order of Crusades.

Most weapon modifications require the weapon to be of certain circle of power,
reflecting the strength of blessings on the Holy Weapon.  
NOTE however, that the increasing in the power of the Holy Weapon is
very much proportional to the rank of the victim put down with its edge.

CRUSADE
syntax: crusade <race or class or cabal>

a Crusade against a particular faction.  A Crusader then leaves any of his
comrades behind, and rides forth against the faction he has chosen to war
against.
While on Crusade, the holy warrior receives substantial combat bonus against
the faction he has chosen to war against, and will move swiftly through
any terrain.  At the same time, the his morale will suffer against
any other foe, and hence will suffer small combat penalty when fighting them.
Note however that the combat bonus against the chose faction is far greater 
then the penalty, and that Crusade is the only way beyond use of Avenger to 
increase the level of Consecrated (Holy) weapon.

-2 crusader~ AVENGER~
AVENGER
syntax:	avenge <corpse>

avenge a fallen victim and bring divine retribution to the wrong doer.  
If the original murdered is within the lands, and not protected from
the Crusader, the holy warrior will leave his comrades and journey forth
with intent of slaying the murderer and bringing justice to the victim.

While avenging a victim, the Crusader will always sense the murderer's
location in the area and the room, even if they might not be able to see
them.  Furthermore when filled with the holy fervor of retribution the
Crusader will strike more powerful blows against the one he is pursuing
even if his moral will suffer if he fights targets other then the intended
murderer.

However, when the mission of revenge is final carried through, any benefits
received towards experience, cabal points or Holy Weapon are greatly increased.

has a chance of damaging the victim's armor reducing its benefit.  Only a 
single such blow may be placed per use of the skill, as opposed to the automatic

anew.  Since one normally has less control over an offhand weapon, those
weapons are much easier to deflect.

-2 crusader~ BATTER~
BATTER
syntax: batter

  A hallmark skill of the Order of Crusades it allows a user of heavy two
handed weapons to strike blows not aimed to damage the victim, but rather to
stun and daze them.  The Crusader uses their weapons to cause blunt damage
to the target, thus staggering them backwards while they soak up the brutal
kinetic forces of his blows.  When a person becomes sufficiently stunned
they may lose grip on their weapons and shields while they recover.

The effect of battering is cumulative and lasts at least an hour or more from
the last battering received.  Unless the weapon is blunt in nature, or the
damage is controlled to be blunt, the damage caused while the Crusader 
concentrates on battering blows is reduced.

#833
-1 Avariel~
Balance. Even the word intones completes harmony. Just as a Scale must

Neutrality. Four sides to a cube, and a Left to a Right.

guides those who would strive to walk the Path of Neutrality. She stands
as it's Angelic Protector and Mother, to watch over the Scale and her 
children of the True Path.

as she guided and taught those who sought to follow her. As time went by,
Avariel began to hear the cries of her children in Aabahran. Transcending time
and space, she emerged  high above in the Heavens of Aabahran. It is from here,

-1 Bryntryst~
No one can say with any degree of honesty that they know of The Ettin's
origins, nor can any say exactly how long it has been it has dwelled among
the heavens watching down upon Aabahran.  But what can be said about the Lord
of Chaos is an unrelenting dedication to nothing and an unwavering
allegiance to all.  Appearing in many forms ranging from a sickening cloud
of foul air to its preferred form, an immense two-headed giant, an audience
with it can lead to either doom or salvation, depending on little more than
the time of day.  It's fancy changes by the moment, a wrathful, angry beast
one moment, and a jovial spirit the next, to decipher it is a task without
possibility of success.
  
With the sudden departure of the Lord of Discord, Bryntryst found that it alone 
possessed the knowledge of Chaos and of the Nexus to bridge the gap between the 
planes and give birth to the children of Discord, Demons.  It was with the 
creation of its infernal army, that it began to entrench its fingers into the 
world of men, influencing them from afar to further its own goals.
  
It was only shortly before the Third Age of Aabarahn that the Angel of the
Balance, Avariel was seduced and misled by Nefar and  recieved the Black
Looking Glass as a gift.  Using this Looking Glass, Avariel was decieved
into believing the mortal world had forgotten her and her charge.  It was
then that she began her descent into Chaos.  When Avariel struck down her
mortal voice, Keene, Bryntryst came unto her, and surrendered the throne
of Chaos, taking the Balance as his own to protect mortals and Immortals
alike.
  
Upon accepting its powers, The Ettin was transformed by its power, and
each of it's two heads became a seperate, sentient being of opposing morals
and abilities.  Though they speak and act seperately, they think in tandem,
with a single consciousness between them both.  There have been many who
have sought to define the twin beings, and understand how one mind can exist
in such a dichotomy, but to no avail.  Its is a dual nature, each of it's
personas possessing a personality of its own.  Crude and crass, compassionate
and kind,  but this is but the beginning of it's demeanor.  It claims
servitude to none but the Balance and those who understand it's importance.

-1 Discord~
DISCORD

You are violent and destructive, a menace to society, and hated by the
masses.  Your parents never disciplined you as a child, and you've grown up
to be an irresponsible, violent plague.  You don't like laws or authority in
general, and you'd rather beat up an innocent child than give money to the
poor.  

The followers of discord are shunned by most of society, and range from
petty vandals looking for a cheap thrill to cruel beasts in search of world
destruction.  They generally resort to violence as a prime solution to all
problems, and tend to reject unity and balance.

GREED

Gold, jewels, power, beauty - these words leave a sweet taste of lust in the
mouth of the being who desires much.  His greed drives him through life,
seeking appeasement and satisfaction, a slight sate for the want that so
hungrily consumes him.  A life led by selfish goals and pushed in a
direction that will better the wealth and prestige of the being that chooses
to enter the gilded cage of Greed.

LIFE

Goodness and Light.  These are the things that the followers of the Path of
Light idealize.  The eradication of evil is a war that has been fought on
thousands of battlefields for thousands of years, and will no doubt be
fought until the end of time.  One who walks this path is dedicated to the
cause of good, and works whole-heartedly against evil in their own way. 
While some take up a blade and strike down the minions of darkness, others
heal the wounded and weary.  Others still travel the lands preaching the
ways of peace, denouncing violence as the root of all of the suffering in
the world.  Regardless of their means, they strive to create a world of
purity, a land devoid of wickedness and wrongdoing.

COMPASSION

You have spent your entire life witnessing first hand the follies of war. 
The price of conflict.  Bloodied bodies, people on the verge of death from
horrid ailments, the crazed lunatics whose minds have been poisoned.  You
have seen all of this, and have sworn to put an end to it.  A divine healer,
or just a soul bent on mercy, you live your life to save others'.  Yours is
a gift best given to others, and better still given freely.  

Every war has its casualties, and the campaign against evil is no exception.
And each day, many succumb to the plagues and diseases spread by those who
walk the path of death.  Regardless of their outlook on war, those who walk
this path all have one thing in common: A love for life, and the desire to
preserve it.  Whether they convert divine energy into blessings of healing
and life, or are merely a friendly ear to speak to, these souls remain true
to life, and do their own part to reclaim Aabahran for the cause of Good.

PURITY

Evil surrounds you.  It is everywhere you look.  The darkness has cast a
grim shadow over everything you hold dear.  The time has come that something
is done about it.  Others waste time and energy in talk, or ignoring it
altogether.  That's why you are different.  Take up arms, and the wicked
shall fall in piles at your feet.  Let them embrace the death they embody,
and save Aabahran in the process.  

The Way of Purity sees evil as a cancer and use arms to remove it,
permanently.  They have sworn their sword arm as the hope of life.  No
longer standing idle as their world crumbles around them, they have sounded
the trumpet of war, and raised the standard, charging headlong into the
fray.  Theirs is a path of war, constant vigilance, for if one ceases to
swing the sword for but a moment, he allows the darkness to advance.

TRANQUILITY

You have never hefted a weapon against another before and you aren't about
to start now.  There are many reasons why people like you exist.  Either
your respect for life is to great to bring an end to another's, or merely
the notion that violence accomplishes nothing, except reducing yourself to
the level of the enemy.  Differences can be resolved through talk, or other
means, but violence begets violence, and fighting with swords and magic only
produces more.  

There are many means to achieve a goal.  One need not force it with the
point of a dagger, or the head of a mace.  Those who do so are foolish, and
see only an easy means to an end.  But life is not always the flattest road;
there are infinite hills and turns that one must negotiate to reach the end
of it.  There is work ahead for he who wishes to eliminate evil, whether
those who walk this path attempt to quell the ways of the wicked with words,
or simply perform so many acts of generosity that evil has no room to exist.

-1 'Religion Equilibrium'~
EQUILIBRIUM

There are many things in life that are quite clearly defined.  Good and
Evil.  Order and Chaos.  But regardless of what you look at, there is always
a fuzzy area that lay between the two opposites.  Whether balance represents
making sure that the balance between good and evil does not stray too far to
either side, or merely not caring about either, those who follow this path,
have chosen to walk their own road.  But, as is everything else, even the
Path of Equilibrium is divided into different factions, each claiming what
true neutrality is.  But as much as they may argue, each of them has lived a
life devoid of clear-cut boundaries.

ORDER

Without law, you are nothing more than the animals.  Slave to Disorder.  Law
and Order are the only thing that raises us above them, good and evil does
not matter; all are the same before it.  Ruling with an iron fist or
creating a civilization that favors neither good nor evil, the law is a tool
to control, to protect, and to gain.  Use it at your whim, but do not
falter.  

The world is ripe with disorder.  Order is the shield that protects the
world's population from destruction.  Before it's blind eye, all are equal. 
The immoral murderer and the pious preacher; all will benefit, and heed,
it's guidelines.  It favors nothing, but elevates itself above all.  It
looks down on none, but is superior to everything else.  It is the only
thing that matters.  But, just as laws are tools, so shall people use them
to their advantage.  Many who live the Way of Order know what they may or
may not be able to get away with, and often corrupt the law to further their
own goals, be it for good or evil.

-1 Neutrality~
NEUTRALITY

Law, Order.  Good, Evil.  Extremes that when left unsupervised, wield
terrible power.  When the balance swings too far to one side, it is your job
to correct it and weigh them a bit more in favor of the underdog, for when
one side tips the scales beyond aid, it will end all that is known.  You are
a servant of the scales, aiding those who are outnumbered.  Or perhaps you
just serve one thing, yourself.  Regardless of your views, you favor neither
law nor chaos, light nor darkness.  But one thing is consistent, while you
walk the lands, the balance shall be maintained, and if need be, defended. 


While there are many who serve established moral factions, those who walk
the Way of Neutrality, serve everything that lay between them all.  They
live in a gray world, ignoring the boundaries of white and black, casting a
protective eye into everything.  Should any extreme begin to gain ground
over the other, neutrality steps in, and rights the numbers, maintaining the
balance between the two.  But then again, there are simply some who do not
care about good or evil, order or discord.  And to these, the way of
neutrality embraces them.  Depending on their mood, their actions lead to
any of the extremes, but call none of them home.

CHAOS

Freedom.  A life devoid of rules, you live according to your own whim, and
nothing else.  Life is as simple as you wish it to be, or as difficult.  But
why would anyone want life to be hard?  If that were the case, you would be
trundling along with the zealots.  You live your life by the day, making no
plans, and heeding nothing.  There are some that call you crazy.  You do
what you wish, when you wish.  How is that crazy?  

Those who walk this way hold no delusions about their moral standing.  Their
behavior is constantly changing, ever altering.  A friendly ear one moment,
and a angry, bitter scowl the next.  People must choose their words
carefully when speaking to them, because you never know how they are going
to react.  There are not many words that can sum up the behavior of one who
follows this way, but it is often said that the only thing consistant about
them is that they are not consistant.

KNOWLEDGE

The world belongs to those who are able to know its secrets.  Knowledge is
the key to true power, and those who walk the Path of Knowledge are aware of
this.  They have dedicated their entire existence to one thing, and one
thing only.  Knowledge.  But it what one does with their wisdom that makes
the followers of the different ways unique.  There are some, obsessed with
the accumulation of arcane secrets, twisting and manipulating them to weave
the most powerful spells in Aabahran.  There are also those who focus upon
martial concepts; war, battle, and tactics.  And yet still those who devote
their lives to the preservation and education of the wild, becoming the
reason that so many dread to trek into the forest.  Whatever the reason or
subject of their intellectual pursuits, those that follow this path should
be assumed all that relates to it.

MYSTIC

The mind.  It is the most powerful weapon in the world.  To those who know
it's secrets.  Harnessing powers beyond comprehension to many, you are able
to invoke columns of flame, conjure fields of energy to shield you from
harm, or even take control of another's mind.  There seems no limit to what
you are capable of, but it is not without price.  You have dedicated your
life on the study of the mystic, all things arcane and divine.  Whatever the
source, this power has come through years of hard work, and diligent study. 
Your chambers are lined with tomes and ancient texts, but your mind has
remembered all of their contents.  

The Way of the Mystic is often a path of loneliness, it's members more often
caressing a book, or spending their nights in the company of a scroll lit by
a candle.  Their existence is focused on the assimilation of all things
arcane.  They have done their research, attended their lectures, and
sometimes have been given the gifts directly from the Gods themselves.  With
their wisdom fresh on the mind, they use this knowledge to exercise their
will.

COMBAT

The life of a warrior.  You have been one since you can remember.  Maybe a
few too many blows to the head, but it is all that you have known.  A weapon
in your hands is an extension of your anger, a field before you is terrain
to be exploited to your advantage in an upcoming fray.  Some of these tricks
and concepts you have learned through formal study, but most of them have
been gained the hard way; broken bones and periods of unconsciousness.  

Battle tactics, weapon training, and the like are the bread and butter of
those who walk the Way of Combat.  Warriors without equal, they have fought
campaigns still remembered, and lived to tell the tale.  But from all the
death and destruction they have been witness to, they have taken with them
wisdom and experience; two things invaluable when you live life for and by
the sword.

NATURE

None are so at home within the wild as you.  You have been raised among the
trees, and from the sway of their limbs, you have learned that which will
sustain you, and that which will kill you.  Within your forest home, you are
master, and there is nothing that eludes your attention.  Much like the
creatures that you share the forest with, it is kill or be killed, and you
know how to do it.  

Rangers and druids are most often followers of the Way of Nature for obvious
reasons, but just because they wield abilities granted to them by Gaia, it
does not exclude others.  Many tales tell of monks, who have found solace
within the arms of the woods, or the warrior who guards a secluded glade. 
All of these have discovered the secrets concealed within the grass, hidden
within the brush, and cloaked within the canopy.  With these at their beckon
call, they make formidable opponents.

RELIGION

In life, you shall devote yourself to a particular god.  You will not select
a patron deity directly, instead choosing a Path best representing your
belief.  Based upon your choices, a deity that best suits your desires and
beliefs will be assigned to you.  This is something taken very seriously,
and one should do their best to represent the God they devote to with the
greatest of respect.  

There are a total of six religions, each subcategorized into three ways.

RELIGION DEATH

Death...  The only certain thing within the world.  Those who walk this path
give their praise to an unknown force, for all of those who fall victim to
it, do not live to tell their tale.  The darkness has woven an opaque web
around itself shielding it from prying eyes, and for good reason.  So long
as the forces of good exists, so shall the armies of Darkness.  And so long
as those of the shadows walk Aabahran's soil, all need fear the night.

You have always had a cruel streak.  Inflicting pain upon
others has always gotten a rise out of you, and as you aged,
the hatred you have for others has grown with you.  You skill
passion for inflicing pain is only surpassed by your skill at
doing it.  You bring pain and death in your wake as you cut a
bloody swathe through your foes.
 
The walkers of this way are as many as those that they prey
upon.  No caste, race, or creed can claim any majority of them,
as they come from every religious or financial category that
exists.  But one thing is consitent among them.  A desire to
destroy, and the means to do it.

Everyone has their hobby.  As a youth, you can remember poking the dead
bird you found with a stick, fixated on the concept of dead things.  You
matured, but so did your pre-occupation with the lifeless.  Prodding sticks
turned to laboratory equipment as your thirst for knowledge of death
changed to an obsession.  You have searched for years for thick dusty tomes
and ancient molded manuscripts, and your labor has rewarded you well.
you know many things that none else do, and soon...  Soon the means to
escape death shall be yours.
 
It would seem that every path of magic possesses its own sages, and the
path of Death is no exception.  Those who wield it's terrible powers
do so for many reasons.  Perhaps they seek a way to cheat death.  To become
undying.  Or maybe they just have grown too weary of mortal companionship
and seek to raise the dead and make their own friend.  Whatever the
reasons, there is no doubting that their work has paid off, and knowledge
truly is power.

CYCLE
 
Death is the great beyond.  Once you pass through it's arches,
never again will you return.  Or will you?  The cycle of life
is a cycle of death.  From death have you came, and so shall
you return to it.  There is no avoiding your fate, so why bother
trying.  You perpetuate the cycle by bringing death to those
whose time has run out, beit in your eyes, or those of your God.
 
Those of the Cycle do not kill out of pure lust or acquisition
of power.  They do so to reclaim souls to add to the pyre, and
perpetuate the endless cycle of death and life.  To attempt to
cheat death is folly, and so long as these people exist, it can
be most dangerous as well.

If there is one thing that unites every being in Aabahran, it is the concept of
faith; Placing trust, veneration, or even love in a being whose power
exceedes that of any other.  But not all love, worship or even believe in
the concept of Supreme Beings.  While some blindly place their faith in the
unseen, others deny the existance of them, deeming them little more than
mortals with an ego.  Regardless of their views, faith is, and always will
be a integral part of life.

With each passing year, every mortal get more and more powerful.  And so it
is with the Gods.  They're nothing more than everyone else.  They just have
found the secrets, and moved on.  Was not everyone a child once?  And when
they were, did not your father seem immortal?  Of course.  You have just

 Faith is for the weak.  People tell of the grandeur of these Gods, but
you know the truth, the wool hasn't been pulled over your eyes.  While you
do acknowledge the existance of these higher powers, you owe them no love. 
They use mortals as pawns, in a cosmic chess game.  They use you as tools to
gain what they wish.  Spoiled brats is what they are.  Too used to getting
there own way.  Seperate yourself from them, sever all ties.  You want
power?  You want favor?  Rely on none but yourself, and show the heavens
that their aid is both unwanted, and unneccessary.
 
Everyone is a tool, just most people don't know it.  There are some who
claim to have their eyes open, but they're the blindest of them all.  If
they only saw that the power was already within them, they could cast off
their shackles and be free of Immortal Will.  The Gods restort to
underhanded tricks and the strategic manipulation of mortal men and women to
achieve their goals.  Is this not slavery?  The time of slavery has ended,
and the age of true freedom is at hand.

There are some who call you a fool for your steadfast devotion to an unseen
entity.  Let them talk, it makes no difference to you.  You have felt the
the touch of a God upon your soul, and you there is no denying that.  They
will see the follies of their ways, when they pass from this world.  The One
has been with you all of your life.  When you uttered your first words, He
was there moving your lips.  The first time you cast a spell, he imparted
his essence into you and made the incantations bear fruit.  Your eyes are
open, you may not see him, but you see his might in everything you behold. 
 
The Church of the One relies on faith placed blindly.  Only by venerating
that which you've no proof truly exists, you demonstrate your devotion. 
Only then can true power be felt.  The synics say that the unseen, unfelt,
and unheard does not exist, rather venerating that which can be experienced
directly.  But just because one cannot see the air does not mean it does not
exist, you must simply accept it as truth.  Let the sheep graze mindlessly
in the field, but when the time for the shearing comes, you will not be left
out in the cold.

you will be automaticly dismounted.

an average flight spell, the duration of their stay is far long. Those

CABAL
 
WHAT IS A CABAL: 
 
A Cabal is an organization of elite individuals which has a specific goal,
agenda and exotic powers granted to them by the Immortals.  They offer a
chance for deeper, more advanced role-play, new friends, opportunity to
ascend in cabal ranks and gain respect, power, and loyalty of their members.
The Cabals of Aabahran are for the most part, player controlled, from
inducting new members, to forming alliances or declaring vendettas against
other cabals.  Your chances for induction and future possibilities in
them, are dictated solely by your relationship with its members and their
opinion of you.
 
Each Cabal fathers a clan whose ideals are identical of the formal Cabal.
It is from this clan that the members of the cabal are recruited.  Aspiring
members join the clans and are selected from the pool by their individual
worth, which is reflected in Clan Points (CPs).  The members of
the cabal are expected to maintain close ties with their fledgling clan
 
`!HOW TO APPLY``: 
 
In order to apply to a Cabal of your choice, first use the "help cabals" 
and "help <cabal name>" commands to check the general theme, and entrance 
requirements and make sure you are allowed to join.  When you feel ready, 
you must then find the Cabal's clan HQ.  Based mostly within the confines
of the three great city-states, their locations are considered secret and
not to be divulged.  Part of the application process is locating these
clans by yourself.
 
Once you have located the Clan HQ, a processing fee of 30,000 gold pieces
is needed to induct you into the Clan.  The clan acts as a recruitment pool
for the actual cabals, which watch over the members and groom prospective
inductees for their aspired position.
 
During their apprenticeship in the clan, each member has the chance to earn
clan points by completing various tasks, as well as for excelling in
roleplaying.  They can also lose Clan Points for failing to display the proper 
effort.  Clan Points are a measurement of that member's potential worth to the cabal, 
and inductees are selected according to how many Clan Points they possess.  If you 
wish to graduate from the clan and become a full member of the cabal, you will need 
to excel above and beyond your clanmates.
 
Once you have been selected for induction by the cabal's Immortal leader,
you will need to compose a well written, formatted application addressed to
the cabal name.  The application subject `!MUST INCLUDE`` words "cabal application"
or it will not be considered.  The members of that cabal will then vote on
your application, and if successful, you will be inducted into the organization
at the rank of Inductee(0).

CABAL POWERS
 
The cabals of Aabahran have all developed various powers intrinsic 
to their own goals, patrons, and believes.  The various powers and 
abilities become available as a member rises in cabal ranks, and
most consume cabal points when used.  The cost for the ability is
visible on the "spell" screen for spells, but can only be noticed
by experience for skills
 
If you do not have enough cabal points to use a skill, or you do not
have the minimum amount of cabal points required to being to use
the power, it will be highlighted in read on "skills" and "spells"
screen.  A cabal power highlighted in such way will behave as if you
had no proficiency in it.
 
Any cabal ability available after the first cabal rank are provided
by specific rooms or buildings that must be constructed by the cabal
before the power becomes available.

-1 'CABAL POINTS' CP CPS~
CABAL POINTS
 
  Your measure of success and usefulness to a cabal is measured 
in Cabal Points or CP's for short.  Each cabal has its own currency
of cabal points and rewards its members with them for various
actions beneficial to a cabal.  You also gain a small amount of
cp's for merely being present in the lands. The exact amount varies
depending on buildings your cabal has constructed, if it is
engaged in a Vendetta against another cabal. You may check the exact 
amount of cp's gained over time using "worth" command.

-1 Rathe~
Rathe's origins are shrouded in mystery. One thing for certain is
that he arrived in Aabahran after Virigoth. Although both serving the
Nameless, Virigoth is more independent. Rathe is a nihilist. He is
single minded and wishes only the destruction of all things living.
He believes life to be a blight and continuously raises armies of
undead and vampires to cleanse the lands. It is rumoured that as
Virigoth moved into the path of Cycle the Nameless conjured up Rathe
to bring a more militant side to the religion of Death.
 
He is an extremely harsh perfectionist with regards to his undead
Horde and it has been known for even the most powerful Vampires to
be crumbled to dust for breaking any of his rules. The favourite god
for sadists, murderers, and pure evil his following will always be
guaranteed.

-1 Jemnath~
It is rumored that Jemnath Aermus once was a hermit eons ago, though no
valid proof was found in the scrolls of the past.  Giving food and shelter
to wanderers and merchants, it is said that by time he became well known to
travellers of all kinds as a peaceful and wise man.  By preaching the ways
of tranquility and peace, the old man soon became target for those not
sharing his believes.  Not even the oldest storytellers know an answer to
what happened to him - one day he was not there anymore, his memories fading
in the blurry vision of times past.
 
Apparently, his body failed him, and by means yet to be comprehended by
mortal imagination, his mind and spirit escaped the dieing shell, ascending
to the higher planes of existence, leaving behind the boundaries of
mortality, preaching the only true way of existence: peaceful coexistence of
all beings.

The cabals follow a rank system where a member slowly moves up within the
cabal hierarchy as he or she is promoted by their peers.  The cabals have
various titles to denoted their member's status, which can be seen on
"whois" command.  The default cabal ranks are as follows: 
 
(I)nductee, (M)ember, (V)eteran, (T)rusted, (E)lder, (L)eader
 
In order to be promoted or demoted, someone in the cabal must create
a promotion or demotion vote for you.  If the passes you will ascend

though it is said that he was not born mortal.  He is a champion to all
creatures of the woods and forests, serving as both defender and protector,
and expects those that serve Her to do the same.  While he knows and
understands the importance of the balance of nature, and its role in the
wheel of life, any violation of one of Her creatures or lands is a violation
of his Lady, and swift retribution from him and his followers is not only be
expected, but demanded.  Only the foolish enter his domain with malicious

-1 BUILD~
BUILD
Syntax: build create <room skeleton>

  The room builder allows a cabal member capable of construction of rooms to
create, edit, replace and describe the rooms that will be built in the
cabal.  Before a "send" command is issued and a vote for the room is
created, the builder must first choose one of the pre-created rooms.  Once
the room "skeleton" is chosen, the NAME, DESC, NIGHT, OUTDOOR, AND EXIT
commands may be used to change various parts of the room to suit the taste
of the builder.  
 
 
At any time the current status of the room you are editing may be displayed
with SHOW command.  An existing cabal room may be SOLD for half its value, 
or you may SEND your building request to be voted on.

When CREATING a NEW exit, you specify direction from the room you are 
IN to the room you hope to build. For all other commands, you specify 
the direction as if you were inside the room you are editing.
 
Example:
To create an exit from the room you are in, leading north to the room you are
building: 
"build exits north"
To build a door in the passage we just created: 
"build exits south door"
To make the door in the north/south passage be closed initialy:

-1 Mircea~
Woven from the fabric of magic, swirled with endless knowledge, Mircea
was forged by the Gods as a tribute to their magical powers.  Created with
the ideas of magical dominance and a lust for knowledge, Mircea was a
testament to all that encompasses the magical arts, a monument to knowledge,
and a display for the cohesiveness of both.
 
Mircea was not created with the ability to separate good from evil, nor does
he possess the logic to see outside of his own neutrality.  Magic knows know
bounds or boundries, nor does he.  His creators placed their hands to his
flesh, and it began to glow.  Mircea's flesh began to distort and a mark
took form.  A tattoo of a sorcerer encased in a ring of magic appeared on
his arm where his distorted flesh was
 
Mircea welcomes all those of true knowledge and magic, of anyway logic of
thought, to become one with the Vortex of Magic.

waited in the shadows for ages, feeding upon the greed and bitter thoughts.
His power grew and he became known to man, gathering worshippers, and finally
ascending into the heavens themselves.  Eitreach is desire manifest and since
he feed on the wants of mortals, he has been known to tempt them to further
their covetousness along.

Born into a poor family that lived in the small village of Shasarazade
Yeralon spent most of her life tending to others.  Becoming the apprentice
to the town healer she learned many ways to care and help people.  After
serving many years for the town healer he eventually became old and passed
his robes onto her.  Many years later it is said that a weird plague passed
through her village and she worked day and night to cure as many as she
could, eventually falling to a greater disease, exhaustion.  Being over 150
years old she never recovered and it was said her corpse disappeared never
to be found.  Many moons later the town of Shasarazade was once again under
attack and some people say her spirit came to save the town once again but
this time never left.  Now she resides in the heavens above showing
compassion to all she meets.  It is said sometimes she can be found dressed
as a simple healer wondering the road helping adventurers.  

Now as she wonders the heavens above she searches for students to learn and
follow in her ways.  Showing compassion to others, being kind and gently,
acknowledging thy elders, and showing proper respect are just a few of the
qualities of her students.  She strives for the healing and mercy of the
people she tends so they do not have to endure the hard life she once had.

Even before Mhalador's accession into the heavens, few combatants could
ever wield an axe without knowing of Mhalador and his sacrifice.  Once a
WARMASTER himself, Mhalador threw himself upon an invoker preparing to cast
a firestorm that would demolish the entire WARMASTER horde.  Near death,
Mhalador rouse to once again lead the horde into the crystal tower of the
SAVANTS.  There in the tower, Mhalador died upon the altar of magic tainting
it with his blood.  Soon after his death, news of Mhalador's sacrifice
reached the heavens where an unknown God granted him eternal life and the
Throne of Blades.  

Not everyone can become a legend, but Mhalador encourages his followers to
take pride in their combat skills and strive to become a warrior of
legendary proportions.  To worship Mhalador is to worship the blade itself.

#911
-1 nefar~
The origins of the being known as Nefar are not documented in any
commonly available document.  However, the mad sage Gomfradir, in his
infamous and highly unreliable "Early history of Aabahran", first mentions a
man named Nefar in his ramblings on the origins of Conclave.  According to
Gomfradir, Nefar was a high-ranking spymaster and covert operative in this
organisation of Death-worshipping fanatics.  During a raid on a monastery
inhabited by a diffuse sect of Sirant-worshippers calling themselves "The
Order of Sanguine Light" Nefar was betrayed and murdered by his own men for
reasons Gomfradir does not mention in his text.  

Nefar's name surfaces later in Gomfradir's manuscript however, but sadly in
one ofthe parts which are nearly uncomprehensible.  In a rambling poem
detailing the Gods and their portfolios Nefar is mentioned as "one of the
Shadelords three, the Duke of Lies, a King to be" in a section detailing the
servants of Virigoth.  Nothing more is written, and very few, if any, know
how he rose to the position he now holds.  Nefar now rules the coalition of
crime-families known as "Syndicate", but reports have it that he rarely
interferes in day-to-day business, leaving such matters in the hands of his
capable mortal leaders.  Unlike some of the other Gods, Nefar's agenda is
not known by mortal man but will perhaps be revealed at some future point in
time.

-1 OOC~
OOC
 
As a general rule, words, expressions, and actions that are not compatible
with a fantasy-based world are unacceptable.  Examples of words that do not 
exist are below followed by a common acceptable replacement used:
 
Exp          - Learning
Hp           - Health
AC           - Defenses
Str 12       - Weak
Str 24       - Very strong
Eq           - Wares, Gear
PK           - Murder, Slay
Level        - Rank, Title
 
In general, using numbers to reference anything is a grey area, instead, if
possible, type out the number in question. The 'report' command will also
give those around you a basic assessment of your current physical and mental
status, and typing "group" will show you the current status of you entire
group. 
 
In relation to cohesive roleplaying, using OOC (Out Of Character) knowledge
to motivate your characters actions is also unacceptable.  Using other
characters to kill enemies of different characters, or saying things such
as "My other character is ____" is frowned upon.  Logging off with one
character and performing an action with another that was swayed by a previous
event is using OOC knowledge to motivate action.  For example, a member of
your group is killed, and you log on a healer to resurrect him.

Not much is known about the shadowy deity Trob.  Many say he was once a
great mortal who was skilled enough to steal and drink from the Chalice of
Souls, others say he was spawned from the very deceit of every person, but
none truly know.  A strange creature indeed, often appearing as a little
halfling, he seems to greatly enjoy his own mischievous actions.  Reports
say that Trob, when manifested as in his mortal visage, mostly enjoys
knocking people unconscious, only to dress them up like life-size dolls. 
Those who engage the deity in banter often find themselves incredibly
confused at his use of nonsense and often times completely original words. 
Though he speaks riddles, it is told that when he becomes serious none can
match him in a test of wit, and if so those that do surely never lived to

GAIA

Gaia.  Nature itself.  Gaia is the lifeforce that bonds all things in
nature.  From the smallest plant, to the largest animal, Gaia is a part of
the collective concious of everything in nature.  Gaia has never been seen
by mortal eyes, instead staying concerned with matters of her own.  There
have been rare occassions mentioned where she has come before the Immortals
of Aabahran, seeking their aid, but these events are unusual indeed.  Legend
speaks of a court of councilors that oversee all in Her realm, ensuring the
safety and bounty of her 'children', and if need be, ascending a mortal soul
to immortality to be Her voice in the lands.  Those who serve Her know the
importance of the balance between all life and nature, and stand as
protectors of her and all that she watches over.

-1 NOBLE NOBILITY~
Aabahran is a place of intrigue and danger, yet not too far from the
caverns and fields of chaos rests the many cities and establishments that
serve as bastions of protection.  These towns and cities are ruled by the
royal houses, and under them the noble houses.  

Those of the noble house are above regular citizens, in that they help
assist the royalty in their day to day tasks of ruling and protecting the
towns and cities.  Each of the three city-states, Rheydin, Val Miran, and
Miruvhor, may have up to 5 noble citizens to help rule.  The rest of the
cities may have up to 3 noble citizens.  

Nobles rule with diplomacy, reserved patience, and impeccable writing and
speech skills.  You will be held in a higher light then the average citizen,
and you shall be expected to uphold these exceptional virtues.  Know that at
any time you fail in your duties, you can, and shall be striped of your
title.  

If you feel you are above the average citizen in every way, you should first
seek the noble clan hall, and pay the fees required to enter.  There, you
shall be groomed by others above you in becoming a noble.  The goal of the
clan hall is to provide a hub for all of Royalty and Nobility alike to
gather, and prepare those new into the noble blood.  However, it is the
decision of immortality to ascend you into the house of your choice.  

Once you feel you are prepared, scribe an APPLICATION to immortal, with the
words "Noble application" in the subject line.  Within the scroll, include
which town's house you wish to step into, and all qualifications you feel
you have.  You will be watched, tested, and judged, after-wards you will be
notified of what else is required of you.  

All mortals should realize that disrespecting a member of either the Royal
or Noble house is not only unwise on a mortal level, but you run the risk of
invoking the anger of the gods them-self.

  The first step in building a room for your cabal, is too choose

Each cabal has a preset collection of rooms that you may choose
from, some serving specific functions or granting special abilities
to your cabal.  Each cabal is also given at least one "dummy" room
that has no specific function, can be completely edited and built
in great numbers.  This room will usually have a name such as

-1 RENT~
HELP RENT
Syntax:  cabal info
 
  As cabals grow and expand, the cabal Elders and Leaders begin to 
issue orders for constructions of rooms that will shape the cabal
to their tastes.  These rooms can either generate, or cost CP's
depending on their nature.  Positive values are income, negative
are costs.
 
  Each cabal has what is called a "rent cycle" that takes full 24
real time hours to complete.  Every cabal statistic dealing with
cabal points, is per rent cycle.  Hence a cabal with income of
500 CPs and rent of -400 CPs would generate 100CPs per cycle (24h)
into its coffers.  If at the end of rent cycle you are significantly
short of CP's to cover your costs, your rooms will be sold for profit
at 50% build cost until the costs are covered.

NOTE:  The actual gain of cps by your cabal happends continously, the
passign of the rent cycle is merely a marker when your cabal coffers
are checked.  If you are significantly short of cps at this time, rooms
and or armies might be sold.

#919
-1 SUPPORT~
HELP SUPPORT
Syntax:  cabal info
 
  Each cabal has a support rating which is based mainly on the amount
of areas it has under control, and reflects its economic strength much 
like the raw supply of minerals, man power, logistics etc.  This value 
is not accumulated like gold or CPs, rather it reflects the cabal's ability 
to support its room, and troops RIGHT NOW.  
 
 As the cabal expands and rooms are built, and troops hired the support
value may be boosted (positive support from areas and raids) or lowered 
(negative support from rooms, armies or raids).  The CP gain for a cabal is 
always equal to 1/10th of the surplus support.
 
Example: 1000 support gain = 100 cp gain per rent cycle.
Example: -500 support gain = -50 cp gain per rent cycle.

 As a cabal takes over areas (if able) it will begin to experience loss 
of support to corruption, to reflect the sprawling empire. The only cure
to this is a Non-Aggression Pacts with the [JUSTICE] cabal.

If your cabal's coffers dip below -1000cps your rooms will be sold until
positive suppport is achieved.

-1 SPONSOR SPONSORED SPONSORSHIP~
SPONSOR
Syntax:  cabal sponsor <character>
 
  The members of cabal may opt to use this type of induction system
in order to focus on quality rather then quantity of their members.
When in use, the system requires any applicant to first seek out
a present member and ask them to "sponsor" them for entrance.  Only
then will they be able to send an application for induction.
 
  When you sponsor a hopeful member four things occur:
1) You cannot sponsor any more people until your pupil's application 
is rejected, or they reach the Veteran status.
2) You have veto powers over all promotion votes regarding the pupil.
3) Any CP penalty applied to your pupil will also be applied to you.
4) When the sponsored person is allowed into the cabal they will being
at rank 1 instead of 0 thus speeding up their progress.

-1 SYNDICATE~
SYNDICATE

There was such time in the history of Aabahran when the crime families of
various city states warred and bickered between each other in their conquest
of the underworld.  Blood of thieves, assassins, and various shady
characters flowed back then as much as of those whom they preyed upon.  Then
with the imminent threat from the undead and the demonic rising upon the
horizon the royal families of ValMiran arose as one in their city and soon
gave a royal order for the first chapter of Justice cabal to be formed in
nearby Ofcol.  

Much like a single mote of dust may start off a chain reaction, the shadowy
crime world of Aabahran was transformed overnight.  The great crime families
joined together seeking stability and power to face this new threat of
organized Law.  And so Syndicate was born.  

Composed of every shade of criminal from whores to deadly assassins, the
Syndicate cabal has established itself as a business enterprise like no
other.  If there is profit to be head, and blood to be spilled their
intricate network of spies, killers and henchmen can be found.  From
espionage to assassinations, from extortion to kidnapping, from drug deals
to legitimate trades their influence may be found in every facet of common
life.  

Yet those whom wish to enter their ranks beware: Though promotion in
Syndicate is as close as exposed back of your superior, those whom take the
quick way through their ranks oft find themselves washed away by the tides
of Dragon Sea.

  The more enterprising members of Syndicate soon realized that while

susceptible to the allure of monetary rewards.
 
  And so the Forgemasters of Syndicate toil day and night to fill the
demand for falsified documents, passes and various bribes that allow
the members of the greatest crime family in Aabahran to pass unharmed
trough scrutiny of all but the most loyal of Justice servants.

  Knowing that at times even the best mind may not overcome the 
opposition and defenses of their targets, The Hands of Syndicate
guided by word of their Rat King set their dark mages to the task
of developing suitable countermeasure.  Fueled by dark magics the
powers of abduction spell are capable of instantly transporting
the user, and the caster to another locale.  While initially an
unskilled user has no control over their destination, as their
skill improves they become capable of abducting to the general
area of their choice, or even another person.

NOTE: Abduction will ignore the diplomatic immunity, and will 
remove it on success.  However it can ONLY be used to targets
who presently have bounties set upon their heads.

Not stopping after development of the magics required for Abduction, the
dark mages of Syndicate created this cruel spell in their greed for graces
of the Rat Queen.  When successfully cast the spell greatly dilutes the air
around the victim causing severe choking and eventually suffocation.  Though
the spell is not powerful enough to completely remove air from around the victim,
its power is quite sufficient to cause severe discomfort and eventual
lack of consciousness.

  The Syndicate cabal continues to maintain that its primary 
income is from its various trades and shops.  However even
the youngest thief knows that it is the bounties given out
for various individuals in the lands, usualy in the not so
secret locales in the major cities.
 
A bounty may be placed upon anyone's head using gold, cabal 
points or limited items as the price of their death.  A single
target may have many individual "bids" from various parties
interested in their death, with the bounty hunter being able
to see each bid, and its contents but not who placed it.

 Members of cabals allied to Syndicate are allowed to buy out
 a bounty set upon their head.  The price of this transaction
 is dependant on the actual bounty and will be quoted when the
 "bounty buyout" command is used before the actual transaction.

NOTE: Bounties marked with (`!$!`3``) symbol have been paid for
by an allied cabal and will grant higher payment, and a larger 
share of the bounty.

of that bid are then transferred to the bounty hunter who
will receive gold, cabal points and equipment contented in
that bid as well as the best three limited items from the
victim based on item level.
 
At the same time, the person who placed the "winning" bid
chosen by the bounty hunter, receives the remaining limited
items from the victim, and the satisfaction of knowing
that their target has been justly done in.
 
The following rules apply to bounties and limited items.
- Only up to 5 limited items may be placed in bids
- The victim must be higher in rank the 40 OR in a cabal

KNIGHTS
 
  Though few believe it these days, there has been such time in annals 
of Aabahran when the lands were free of the taint of Undead and Demonic
and the people of the land led their lives free of the corruption visited 
upon them by the powers of Nexus.
 
  Yet as all good things come to an end, so did this grand age of happiness
and in the time when the JUSTICE was weak, and the Royal Houses young the
shadowy powers of darkness were first spotted upon the horizon by the Royal
House of ValMiran.  Wasting no time the ValMiran royals gathered with the
Houses of Rheydin and Miruvhor and quickly formed an elite force of men and
women to counter this threat.  Called the Knights of the Crown, and guided by
the Royal Houses, they were Aabahran's last defense against the tides of 
darkness.
 
Yet seeing the House of Rheydin fickle in their loyalty and pursuit of
riches, and the House of Miruvhor often allied with the dark powers the
newly formed Knights of the Crown knew that only by remaining independent
of these squabbling royals, will their victory be assured.
 
And thus the Knights of the Crown were formed, and upon their shoulders
rested the safety of Aabahran as they searched for the True King to once
again unite the Royal Houses and bring harmony and peace upon the land
once more.
 
SPECIAL TRAITS:  Experts in fortifications, Knights construct better bastions.
Any area owned by them, will grant moderate health recovery bonus to any 
good or neutral aligned creature.

  Formed from the fighting core of the elite warriors of the Royal Guard,

Fiercely honorable and known to fight against all odds with reckless courage,
it is said that the souls of their fallen are reincarnated as the Holy 
Vanguards to forever battle the evils upon Aabahran.
 
 The Praetorians draft only the best into their ranks, and require their
recruits to serve as squires before passing grueling tests to become a member
of their ranks.  Those whom aspire to join them in service to Aabahran should
hold Honor and Courage in the highest regard.
 
 The Praetorian faction believes that only through military campaigns against
those whom seek to taint Aabahran will peace be brought to the land once more.
To this end they travel the land forever on the lookout against forces of Nexus.

  Soon after the first major campaign against the forces of Undead and Demonic
was won, a great unrest developed amongst the forces of Knights of the Crown.
Many thought that only by continuing the battle and completely eradicating
the unorganized forces of darkness will a full victory be achieved.  Yet there
were also those whom seeing the bloody price of the recent victory, preached
that to follow such path would be to suffer a pyrric victory.
 
  Their forces weakening due to internal strife, the Knights of the Crown
sought compromise, and so the faction of SIGIL was born.  Composed of the those
whom would forgo the blind aggression of Praetorian and temper it with wisdom
and foresight, their members watch over the lands of Aabahran for signs of
corruption and evil.
 
  Rarely found far from battle, the Sigils as they are called are renown for
their wisdom and knowledge as well as uncanny ability to ferret out all evil
no matter how well disguised.  Often serving as scouts and watchers of the 
Knights, no servant of darkness has been able to fool their sight.

Cabal being traded with         Pact Type (Trade, NA-Pact, Alliance)

When formed this pact allows for trade to flow between the two 
cabals, adding additional gain of cabal points and support
based on the raw income of each cabal.  The initial trade
gain starts as negative to reflect the investment of resources
required to forge new trade routes, then with increasing
relations grows upwards.
 
The "rating" of the pact, reflects the relations between the two 
cabals.  It will grow better in time, and can be further boosted 
by tithes and specific actions of cabal members.  When the pact 
reaches high enough rating, a NEGOTIATE pact may be created by 
either one of cabals, which if voted and agreed upon will allow 
the trade pact to progress to NA-Pact, and NA-Pact to Alliance 
carrying further benefits such as no sudden Vendettas, unrestricted 
entry to Allied cabal grounds, and sharing of military resources.

The relations with various cabals are very dynamic and can be impacted
by actions directed against other cabals.  If you hold relations with
cabal A and cabal B whom are also allied with eachother, any harmful
action against A will result in suffering relations with B etc.  This
means that decisions that have a potent impact on your cabal politics
should be weighted carefuly as to not leave your cabal weakned due to
lack of trade or numerous Vendettas.
 
Any negative actions such as killing a member of your allied cabal
(bounties do not affect relations) will hamper the relations between
your cabal, as will failure to fulfill services listed in HELP 
TRADE2

TRADE2
 
The following service cabals will offer specific advantages
to its trading partner, in exchange for cost in trade.
 
JUSTICE:
  Any Royal cabal forming trade with Justice will
  have their city become Lawful, and will gain ability to 
  set laws within their city.  While their home city remains
  lawful the Royal House and all its members will enjoy a
  large boost to the gain of cabal points over time.

    Justice NA-Pacts and higher also help to curb corruption
    for cabals with large support ratings.
 
  Correct marking of criminals, capture and judgment will
  all improve relations.  Failure to recognize crimes will
  hamper them.

SYNDICATE:
  Alliance:  Allows you to use your cps to buy out any bounties
    set on you. See HELP BOUNTY for more details.
 
  NA-Pact:  You gain access to the network of spies that will
  allow you to gain information on other cabals using "cabal info",
  and "cabal armies" command.  You will also be informed when a 
  bounty is set on your head, by whom, and will be able to glimpse 
  who is bountied.
 
  Collection of allied bounties will increase relations.
  NOTICE: Collection of a bounty on an allied cabal member has no
  impact on relations, unlike normal attack and death.

-1 VENDETTA~
VENDETTA
An official declaration of armed action against another cabal.  
It boosts the time gain of cabal points for members, as well as 
allows attacks of the enemy cabal by your armies.  Unlike other
cabal pacts, the "rating" of Vendetta will start out as "good"
and with armed action grow worse to reflect the suffering relations.
If no armed action is taken for extended time, the relations will
improved to the point where Vendetta will break off automatically.
The same may be achieved with a PEACE pact.

Cabals whom you have Vendetta against will have their armies automaticly
attacked by your patrols, and their members will be attacked on sight
by your cabal guards.

An army is the basic unit used by cabals to wage armed conflict.  The
cabal members act as generals of their troops and from any place in the
land may direct their armies to wage war upon their enemies.

For details on each army command use "help army <command>"

BASTION
 
A bastion is any static defense built by a cabal's army to defend
and secure an area.  When in an area that has reinforcement (see
HELP REINFORCE) an army can be ordered to build a bastion through
garrison order.  Once built, the bastion can be garrisoned with
troops increasign their armor value to that of the bastion.
 
TAKING OVER AN AREA:
Each area has a maximum number of bastions it can support.  If a
cabal builds more then half that maximum's bastions they conquer it.
An area that has no bastions will eventualy rebel against the cabal
that holds it, and turn neutral.  You can find out how many bastions 
your cabal has in an area and its maximum using "[M]ap" army command.

-1 REINFORCE REINFORCEMENT~
REINFORCEMENT
 
A key idea required for successful warmongering is the concept
of reinforcement. An area is reinforced if your armies can get
to it by traveling through allied territory.
 
Armies in areas that are reinforced will gain +10% defense per hour
as long as they are out of combat.  Bastions require more effort to
rebuilt and will gain +5% of their defense.  Since armies cannot heal
or move into an unreinforced area it is crucial to protect your supply
routes.
 
Example:
  Cabal-A-B
	  |
	  C-D
"A" belongs to KNIGHT, KNIGHT can reinforce "A", "B" and "C" but not "D"

-1 'ARMY COMBAT'~
ARMY COMBAT 

Army combat occurs when two hostile armies occupy the same room.  The
armies which have just arrived become the attackers, while the armies
previously present become defenders.

Armies battle untill either all the attackers or all the defenders
are destroyed.  When an army is defeated, the remining forces always
target the army with the lowest defense.  Bastions do not take part 
in battles untill all of the defending patrols and garrisons are destroyed.

FLYING ARMIES:  Flying armies are capable of partially attacking all
of their opponents in the area.  However the damage caused is weakened
for each additional opponent. (Full damage to first, 1/3rd to second
1/9th to third and so on.)

-1 WARDER~
WARDER
 
Since people began gathering like cattle into a pen, they have built
structures to house themselves and to protect each other from their
neighbors.  As they grew the names changed with the size of the structure,
village, town, city.  They hold many names, and have many uses for those
that live there, but they are a cancer upon the lands and nature.  They are
lands stolen, taken from the creatures that called them home to serve those
that intruded and claimed them for their own.
 
With these structures firmly built, the intruders then proclaimed
themselves rulers of the lands, Royalty, and declared their words the laws
of the land.  These thieves believed that by killing and razing the sacred
glades of nature, it gave them the right to govern all.  How wrong they
were, for nature rebelled, and the spirit of nature cried out to its
followers, seeking those that would restore its lands, and drive out the
thieves that stole them from its grasp.  And so they came to answer the
call, and were given the name Warder.  Their purpose was simple and direct:
Drive out the false rulers of the cities, those that uphold their laws, and
to tear down and reclaim what they had caused to be.

-1 Nexus~
NEXUS
 
The struggle for good and ill has been waged since time began.  And upon
Aabahran's soil, it still wages on.  But there has been no war so epic
and grand in scale as the war between the Knight of the Crown and Nexus. 
 
Hundreds of years ago, when the world was still young, there spawned a
legion of undead fighting alongside demonkind.  Their numbers, while small
had a tremendous impact upon the world and it's residents.  In response to
this unholy threat, the city-states of Val Miran, Rheydin, and Miruvhor
created a vast army to battle the legion, and send them back from whence
they came.  And for many decades the cities fought together, and the end of
the Legion seemed unavoidable.
 
However, the ruler of the Miruvhorian Throne, soon fell in league with
the armies of death, and succumbed to their wishes, granting them warriors
to secretly battle the cities to the west.  They watched from the shadows as
the legion spared their city, and moved on.
 
The City of Rheydin, more intent on money and power, withdrew their troops
and bolstered their own defenses, hoping to fight off the infernal army if
they dared attack their gates.  They watched from their counting rooms as
the legion spared their city, and moved on.
 
Though many of their number had fallen, the remaining forces of evil were
far from defeated.  They hid, reorganized, and became what is now known as
Nexus.  Bent on the eradication of Light, and the enslavement of Aabahran, they
have made unholy pacts with the denizens of the underworld and the planes of
Chaos to better strike down their ancient enemies, The Knights of the Crown.

SPECIAL TRAITS:  The hordes of Nexus enter Aabahran through unholy gates.
This cabal can recruit more armies and do it faster then normal.
Nexus areas cause slightly more damage with weapons and spells then normal.

PANDEMONIUM
 
Shortly after the first battle was lost against the newly formed Knights of
the Crown, the forces of death drew into seclusion and began their dealings
with the divine forces of evil.  Though the mass of the troops were warriors,
dealing death by blade and fist, there remained a small contingent of unholy
clerics and magi.  Reasonably more intelligent and cunning, these spell-users
withdrew from the front ranks, and parlied with the otherworldy represntatives
of evil.
 
Seeing more power in foresight, and manipulation, the faction now called
Pandemonium sat in the rear lines, destroying hope and their enemies will
through deal-making and propoganda.  Through intense study of demon-summoning
and the like, they augment the warriors of Nexus with infernal magics, and
summoned fiends to do their bidding.

REAVER
 
With the first defeat by the Knights of the Crown, humiliation washed over
the front ranks of the unliving, demonic horde.  In their retreat, the front
rank fighters of the battle swore never to be defeated again.  With the aid
of the faction of unholy seers, Pandemonium, they summoned and bound infernal
servants to their cause.
 
From the seeping pits of the Nexus came forth demons like those the world has
never seen, and from these masses formed a core of soldiers that along with the
legions of darkness that joined them were to be known as Reavers upon the world.
The Reavers has been said to wield the very energy of the Nexus as blades in
their conquest of the lands.

Bards are the jacks of all trades in Aabahran.  Dabbling in every
profession but excelling in none, they are daring swordsman with a flashy
style of combat, capable thieves and rudimentary spell casters, making their
living as rouges, adventurers, minstrels, and storytellers.  They also
possess the ability to weave powerful magical enchantments using their songs
and instrumental music.  Their melodies can quicken one's feet for battle,
provide nourishment and drink for entire gatherings, or strike down their
enemies with crippling weakness and powerful magic. 
 
Although they lack the specialized abilities of other professions, the 
Bard's diversity and flexibility makes them an easy class to survive with
and perfect for those whom have just begun to get their feet wet in the PK 
environment.

this conduit the caster calls upon themselves the attention of the vile
demigod only to let loose its fury at later time.
 
When first cast Moloch blesses you with a weakest of gifts, as it observes

in power.  When you wish to release its effects upon the one whom you are
in combat with, simply cast the spell the second time.

NEMESIS (Min 500 cps)
Syntax: nemesis <target>
 
There is an ancient legend told in lands of Aabahran to the younglings, a
tale of a proud and noble Knight in another country perhaps even another
world.  The Knight knew no defeat and no weakness of character.  Yet he fell
madly in love with a beautiful princess, for whom he left his blade, kingdom
and lands behind to travel to her own homeland.  They lived there for
sometime and the Knight knew true happiness with his new wife.  Yet one day
as he returned to his home to find his beloved in lover's embrace with a
dark man he did not know.  In fit of terrible rage born of anguish and
betrayal the Knight slew his lover and pursued the other in vain.
 
Days went by as the Knight searched in his quest of revenge.  They turned
into weeks then months then years, the thirst of elusive revenge driving the
Knight's mind deeper and deeper into the dark recesses of madness.  No one
knows how long this Knight searched, nor how long he lived before his flesh
finally gave out under the unyielding yoke of a broken mind.  Yet it is said
that his corrupted and twisted spirit still rides through the Limbo and
Nexus, its blank featureless face madly seeking any living thing which it
may become to take yet another soul in its mad quest for vengeance.

-1 Savant~
SAVANT
 
Aabahran was scarred and burnt when the final battles of the War of the
Legions had been won.  The broken forces of the darkness that would be NEXUS
and the rebellious ranks of KNIGHT had each taken refuge in the far corners
of the world.  But unbeknownst to them both, another force lay in waiting. 
Nearly a year to the day after the Great War, a tall featureless tower
appeared unexplainably upon the horizon.  It's walls were devoid of life,
but the multitude of rooms were filled with scores of ancient tomes,
moth-eaten and time-worn.
 
The massive doors of the tower remain closed for eons, turning away those
who sought entrance within.  But then, without explanation, they opened. 
Within the next few decades, magi from across the lands entered the tower
and partook of it's knowledge.  Armed with their new-found knowledge, they
emerged from the Tower on a quest to drive ignorance from the lands, and
educate the world in the ways of magic.  For their hermetic ways, and vast
pools of knowledge, the populace of Aabahran dubbed these scholars SAVANTS.  

Special traits: Savant armies are summoned or created.  Their armies 
cost extra to recruit and train, but are more powerfull and always fly.  
Any mage or half-mage present in Savant owned area will recieve their aid in 
regeneration of mental powers.

MYSTERUM
 
Beyond the limits of mortal vision, lay planes of energies that defy
explanation.  It is rumored that these are the planes of the Immortals, or
the borders of worlds other than our own, but only a select few know for
sure.  Steeped in long-forgotten knowledge, the ranks of MYSTERUM see
beyond, immersing their minds in these energies and learning from them.  
 
The contact with these powers take their toll, however, and often, these
sages show evidence of delving too deep.  Eccentric and unpredictable,
MYSTERUM are the eyes and ears of SAVANT, casting their gaze beyond, in
efforts to garner what will aid their quest to bring knowledge to the
masses.

The river of time runs swiftly, and it's course has brought magi from all
the corners of Aabahran to guard it's flow.  With the appearance of the Tower
those who studied within it's walls learned how to manipulate and even
change the course of time.  With time comes wisdom, and with wisdom, comes
power.  The members of TEMPORUM, rather then spend time towards aimless
divination and gazing into the beyond seek to unlock the secrets of time
itself through application of their knowledge.  
 
Their minds are like knifes, and their whispers are words with power to 
cut open the curtains of universe and reveal the treasures beyond.  With
the flow of time at their beck and call few are those whom would dare to
oppose them.

-1 Warmaster~
WARMASTER

From the settling mist of the War of the Legions stood many battle- hardened
warriors of enormous experience and strength.  Attempting to return to their
normal lives, they found that they only thirsted for the rush of battle, the
warcries of friend and foe alike.  Unable to return to their normal
societies, these warriors joined together, secretly at first, to continue
sharpening their battle tactics.  

After some time of this secret sparring the Warriors decided they could no
longer conform to their own lives and removed themselves from civilization,
out to where they could feel the rush of near-death whenever the need arose.
Naturally through their dedication these great war veterans learned and
traded battle tactics, creating an art of physical combat with no mortal
equivilant.  

From these warriors a great society has risen based on three major values:
Honor, Physical Strength, and Self Reliance.  Combining these three
strengths the Warmasters of the land have managed to grow to a world power,
rivaling the most powerful armies with their own strengths.  Commoners often
report seeing these behemoths standing on street corners evangelistically
preaching the arts of self- reliance.  It is also said that those who dare
heckle their ministries often find themselves hanging from a pike, used as a
sparring dummy for new recruits 
 
Special traits: Due to their experience and charisma each Warmaster general
can command and field two armies more then usual.
Any warrior class traveling through Warmaster owned area will use less movement
and regain it faster then usual.

From within the secluded civilization formed by veterans of the
War of the Legions a sect branched consisting of those warriors who sought
absolutely natural means styles of combat, and total honor in battle.  These
noble blademasters have discovered ancient forms and stances to aid them in
battle, bringing themselves far greater strength than most magics can grant.
Reports from those watching these masters at work have told great tales of
immeasurable accuracy and precision with their weapon masteries.  The
Gladiators have taken the goals of the Warmasters to an extreme, relying
solely on their own power and becoming models of their own preachings.  A
sheer statue of physical prowess, few who battle Gladiator in natural form
have survived to share the tale.

CHAOS BLADE
Syntax:  cast 'chaos blade'
 
Drawing on the very forces of evil and chaos itself, a Reaver can
temporarily call into being a weapon of darkness.  It extends from 
the wielders hands as a weapon of random elemental material to strike 
down any foes foolish enough to stand against them. Using the powers 
of spawn blade for manipulation, and by binding torments to the chaos
blade, the Reaver can increase the potency of the weapon.  Elders can
manipulate and focus the energy to form weapons of specific materials.

-1 BARBARIAN~
BARBARIAN

Shunned by their fellow warriors, the BARBARIANS secluded themselves even
more from their society and the rest of the world to further develop a
fighting style all their own.  Often imploring what may be considered
thuggish tactics to some, it is not uncommon to see these seemingly rough
cut men use every aspect of the battlefield to their advantage from the dirt
on the ground to trampling their opponent while they are down.  

While those that call themselves the BARBARIANS are every bit as skilled in
combat as the GLADIATORS, these brutish men have chosen to rely on more than
just their skill with a blade.  While the principles and ideals of the
warrior lifestyle still hold true to these men of combat, it is their belief
that having the upper hand on their opponent is the key to victory whether
it is by their skill alone or accepting arcane forces.

can be modified:
 
Elongate:  This changes the blade into a two-handed weapon.
Fortify:  Extends the life of the blade.

TORMENT BIND
Syntax:  cast 'torment bind' <Moloch/Bael>
 
When a Reaver casts this spell upon a chaos blade, he calls upon one of
two Nexus demigods to imbue his blade with a portion of their power.  The
demigod called upon determines the powers granted.
 
Moloch:  Allows the blade to ignore any resistance and vulnerability that the foe
may have.  It also boots the strength of afflictive spells cast.

control and shape the very essence of discord and chaos.  Calling
upon these powers they may form the Chaos Spawn, and bind its

Due to their extensive training of anatomies, monks are able to strike points
in the bodies of their opponents quite hard, capitalizing on any potential
weaknesses, and exploiting them.  This strike has the potential of disrupting
the protective shield of a spellcaster, thus making them succeptable to bashes
and bodyslams.  This brutal attack is highly damaging, and leaves one's apponent
stunned for a moment as he or she recuperates from the strike.  Unliving opponents

Many different races of people call Aabahran home, but many more still have yet
to emerge from the hidden parts of the world.  
 
The Implementors of the Forsaken Lands have given you the oppurtunity to apply
to have a custom race, limited only by your imagination.  Before you apply how-
ever, please consider these criteria:
 
1)  You must have exceptional RP.  From the second you entered Aabahran, you have
exemplified everything that your desired race is.  At no point in time should
you break RP and 
 
2)  Your desired race needs to be somewhat compatible with your original (ie,
no elves applying to be giants, or vice versa.) This is not a tool to bypass
racial vulnerabilities, etc.  Your desired race must also be within mortal
bounds, and not 'immortal' races, such as angels, devils or the like.
 
3)  An extremely well-written description is required.  If you do not have this
completed, do not even apply.  Your description will be checked by more than one
immortal, and it will be good to pay special attention to it.
 
4)  Send a note in APPLICATION form to 'Immortal', detailing your character's
history and it will be reviewed.  A well-written application is required.  The
application should be no more than 70 characters per line, and be thought out
and formatted.
 
The above criteria are merely a guideline, and there are more things that are
considered when a custom race is approved/declined.

HITROLL DAMROLL SAVES
 
HITROLL:  You will find that many items add or subtract from your 'hitroll'.
This is a measure of your accuracy in combat.  A high hitroll will aid you in
bypassing an opponents armor, defenses and hit more frequently.  In addition
to items, your strength will effect hitroll as well.
 
DAMROLL:  In addition to hitroll, some items often effect damroll as well.
This is a measure of how much damage your attacks inflict.  Your hitroll will
be added to your weapon's damage to determine your total damage.  Things such
as certain spells, abilities, and armor class will increase or decrease the
amount of damage that you will deal.
 
SAVES:  Sort of an AC against spells, saves will prevent or reduce the effects
of spell cast upon you by an opponent.  Saves begins in the positive and go down
as they improve so it is beneficial for your saves to be as far into the negatives
as possible in each of the four categories.

ROLEPLAY ROLEPLAYING RP
 
Roleplaying is not merely required here at The Forsaken Lands, it is enforced.
You are all expected to develop a personality for each of your characters and
act accordingly.  Roleplaying is something that can only be bettered with a lot
of practice and here are but a few keywords that will aid you in defining your
character(s) personality:
 
Family:  Was your character an only child?  Did he/she have siblings?  If so,
how many?  What did your parents do?  How did they act?  Are they still living?
 
Early Childhood:  What was your character's youth like?  What did he/she do for
fun?  Did he/she have many friends, or was he/she a loner?
 
Likes:  What sort of things/activities does your character enjoy doing?  Maybe
your character enjoys whittling wood, and is known to pull out a chunk of wood
and carve away.  Perhaps your character enjoys nothing as much as a nice cigar.
It may be a hobby, a particular food, or even a group of people.
 
Dislikes:  What sort of things does he/she dislike?  Maybe he/she isn't fond of
onions, or maybe the smell of leather drives him/her to anger.
 
Long/Short Term Goals:  What does your character want to accomplish in the near
future?  This could be such things as being accepted into a particular clan or
cabal, or even defeating an enemy.  What about in the long run?  Does he/she
want to destroy every gnome in Aabahran, or save them all?
 
This is but a short list of examples.  Expand a bit and your character will no
longer seem to be a string of numbers and letters, but a living and breathing
person all its own.

Syntax:  cast 'overload' <item>
 
As being the case with most portable items of power, wands and staves can
only function a limited amount of time before becoming useless.  Heralds,
with their knowledge of such things have learned to manipulate such items
and unleash their true potential.  Through the use of this ability, Heralds
may increase the maximum amount of charges an item is capable of possessing.
When this is used upon an object the maximum charges of that object are
increased by 50%.  However due to the extreme stress placed upon the item,
this ability can only be used once upon any given object.

CREATE ARTIFACT
Syntax:  cast 'create artifact' <item>
 
Being masters of history, Heralds are able to discover items that have
long held hidden powers.  Through careful manipulation and study, Heralds
are able to unleash those powers.  By casting this enchantment upon an a
relic, a Herald can cause the relic to 'remember' it's past and create a
powerful artifact brimming with the power of the ancients.

#1065
-4 cabal~ 'invoke artifact'~
INVOKE ARTIFACT
Syntax:  invoke <item>
 
Once a relic has been transformed into an artifact, a Herald can brandish
said relic and unleash it's power.  The type of relic comes into play in
determining the nature of the artifact's magic, and each artifact can only
be invoked a certain number of times before the item crumbles and becomes
nothing but inert dust.

-1 sing~
SING
Syntax: sing <song> <target>
 
Before you can sing a song, you have to rehearse it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Singing a song costs
mana.  The mana cost decreases as your level increases.
 
The <target> is optional.  Many songs which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.
 
If the song name is more than one word, then you must quote the song name.
Example: sing 'Rest Thy Feet'
Quoting is optional for single-word songs.  You can abbreviate the song name.
 
When you sing an offensive song, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the song is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.  Singing an offensive spell on yourself will
result in memory impairment for you to sing that song in the future lowering
your skill in the song.
 
You are also able to freeverse your own songs.  Singing freeverse allows
you to make up your own songs, and 'sing' them free of a mana charge.
 
Syntax:  sing freeverse <lyrics>
For example; if you input, 'sing freeverse Days of summer are long and hot.'
You will see this:  You sing '`6Days of summer are long and hot.``'  Now keep in
mind that this command, like any other can and will be taken away if used in
an inappropriate manner.

-1 Endrios~
Not much is known of this winged man clad in the purest of golden armors. What
is known, is that he was rescued from the crimson depths of the Nexus Realm by
the giant Ghorn, and entered the World of Aabahran as another Immortal. He has
claimed that he was born of another World, unknown to this one, where he looked
over his people as a High Guardian. This distant World eventually surrendered to
the terrors of the Demon race, its entire mortal population meeting extinction.
Endrios was not killed, but was instead taken prisoner inside the Demon Rift and
was held there for over a century. 
 
His handsome features and typically calm demeanor are not to be misinterpreted 
for signs of weakness. It is widely rumored that on top of Endrios' Immortal 
strength, his blinding speed is unequalled even among the other Gods of 
Aabahran. He is very often characterized as a friendly and talkative man, but 
quick to anger at times with those that would seek to ridicule or disrespect 
him or other followers of the Light. It is now believed that Endrios lives only 
for Purity, and the closest of circles often whisper that he seeks to avenge 
the loss of the family that he failed to protect in the past. Despite his warm 
nature, many of the more cynical quarters argue that this man is not truly what 
he claims to be.

direction as well as taking a substantial amount of damage.

-1 Arithis~
Once long ago there was a duergar boy born into the normal world of many
duergar boys.  As he grew he came to know that he had a talent for death and
how he longed for the yearning of it.  He went on in life to study these
ways with many, many corpses and was mainly shunned by his community.  He
was finally exiled from his hometown of Gal'Rhanidon after he took the
corpses of his own parents and tore them to pieces trying to figure out how
to make the perfect human.  
 
After many long years of solitude and lonliness Arithis emerged again and
was welcomed back into the world as a normal person since many of the elders
of the community had died and forgot him.  When he returned to Gal'Rhanidon
he noticed much had changed and decided to make his way to the surface,
since of course he had found a way to adapt his body to the sunlight.  When
Arithis arrived on the surface he found that much was different from what he
thought.
 
Arithis, after many years of wondering the surface, then came upon a
gigantic black fortress that was twisted and crippled by time.  The sheer
size of this tower is unexplainable and it seemed to phase from realm to
realm, never being truly whole.  Inside this fortress he found a great demon
that took him as his apprentice and taught him all that he knows today.  As
his final act to his master Arithis took his life and drained the blood of
the demon heart into a mixture he had concocted from his knowledge in hopes
of gaining Immortality.  With one final gasp after drinking the cup mixed
with solution he fell dead upon the floor.
 
Not long after this Arithis awoke to find himself in a spectral sort of
world where he could travel and do as he pleased and so he stayed on Aabahran
and began his studies anew.

#1086
-1 peikloz~
His parents were forced away from the avian race, so Peikloz Troy was
born in Rheydin where he would live for the rest of his mortal life.  His
blood, both avian and human, was unacceptable to many.  He swore not to
become like those that hated him, and to instead live with as much tolerance
for others as possible.
 
As a child he found himself to have strong connection with books.  As he
couldn't bear to leave any unread, he would stay up late every night, simply
reading..  Eventually he became a scholar where he was constantly tormented
by those who could not understand this obsession, but he never let their
words get to him.  Instead he became stronger in his beliefs.  His
dedication for studying increased and days did not go by when he didn't
visit the library.  Once he graduated from the school he joined the invoker
guild.  There, he quickly ascended within the ranks of his guild and it didn't
take long until he had reached his pinnacle.
 
He made connections with many that held the same interests and beliefs that he
did.  Even though he wished to join the Savants, the time never came.  Instead,
his dedication was focused towards the Academy which he joined soon after its
construction.  There, he was recognized for his dedication to the education
of others and eventually was named the Dean.  Soon, the time came when his
knowledge had reached a point beyond the potential of most mortals and was
named Hero of the Invoker Guild.
 
Yet, his curiosity still grew, and allowed him to solve many mysteries. 
He eventually came across rumours that spoke of granting a worthy Mortal the
gift of Immortality.  The rumours spoke of a well that only he could find
thanks to the supreme knowledge that he had acquired in his lifetime.  Some
say that Peikloz took a sample of this precious water for his own quest for
knowledge and, using his hightened arcane powers, destroyed the well itself,
preventing all others from claiming his prize.

-1 Sylvantis~
The origin of the Colossus Sylvantis is a mystery.  Even, they say to the
heavens themselves.  His history is that of lore originated by a means all
the more mysterious.  Ancient tablets from a time long forgotten were said
to have been chiseled by a non-descript beggar overcome by a trance.  On the
vernal equinox when night and day held equal sway the illiterate beggar had
finished his work and stood at central square.  He recited that which he
wrote.  Its said that when finished he snapped from his trance, dropped the
stones and wandered off without a word.  Most ignored the rantings and the
shattered stones dropped by a mad man, but some had listened.  The story
today has many versions, some more outrageous than others. 
  
Its said the Colossus was a mandate from a higher power to elucidate the
bickering masses of both mortal and immortal disagreements; An objective
arbitrator and divine judge of all things.  Its said that neither the nature
of the disagreement nor the severity of it sways his judgment.  For the
Colossus to achieve such objectivity the powers that wrought his existence
made his essence mortal.  He was reborn under many names over thousands of
years.  Each time, he worshiped a different religion.  Each time, he
embraced a different philosophy of life.  Its rumored that both the
benevolent and evil Gods searched relentlessly for this eventual divine
judge of the heavens; Some to influence him others who claimed to protect
him from the former.  In the end, In his last mortal form Sylvantis, the
Colossus had a revelation.  Its said all of his lifetimes flooded back to
his consciousness, his fate became known to him and he rose to his destined
place in the heavens.  To this day Sylvantis holds favor to his last mortal
life and stands besides the forces of benevolence and good.  However, when
asked to judge the Colossus holds no favor and is the essence of
objectivity.  His decisions are final and to question his judgement is to
invite his anger.  Anger thats fed by the darkest and most vile experiences
lived over a thousand lifetimes.

-1 Luqin~
Born a mortal, raised a disciple of the virtues, ascended as a mystery. 
Thus describes the one known today as Luqin of the Enigmatic Light.  Luqin
displays the very ideals of compassion even through the many mysteries that
shroud his past, and future.  Soon after his ascension, Luqin awoke in a
shroud of pure energy, without memory, without identity.  All that was known
was that he was different, in many ways.  The voices of Aabahran were heard,
the thoughts, the prayers, the hopes, and the dreams.  Time was lost, and
space was obsolete.  All that remained was existence.
 
As his existence progressed, new powers and old memories alike were
discovered, though never to this day has the entire truth been uncovered. 
However, through the help of many mortal men and women, Luqin found the
compassion of his previous life, and using his new powers, Luqin was able to
exemplify this very virtue of compassion to the mortal world, in hopes of
one day calming the ever present tide of darkness on Aabahran's surface.  Was
this the meaning of his ascension?  Or was it merely another plot of
darkness that has gone awry?  Perhaps one day these mysteries will be
discovered, until then, the only truth that needs to remain is that of
compassion and hope for all living mortal beings, and the existence of Luqin
shall be ever living, projected into the minds of those willing.

In the time following Sirant's fall, the universe was in turmoil.  Most
went unnoticed by mortal eye, but the balance in the heaven was gone.  A
mortal warrior, Vuurk, sat in meditation near a waterfall in the Orc
Mountains as the energy swept through him.  Perhaps he was in the right
place at the right time.  Perhaps this was the reason for his birth.  In any
case, the energy lingered within the storm giant changing him. 
 
With the strength of his arm, his will, and his faith, Vuurk became the
patron saint of the Knights.  And he guides them and any who would seek he
guidance into battle against the demons and any who would harm an innocent.

There was a day not long ago that the energy from every scream and cry
from a lawful citizen was channeled to the same place, a pocket in the
heavens that consumed and grew with each passing day.  With the building of
the energy and the room finaly reaching its capacity everything within began
to merge and form into a single entity, the entity named itself Arther. 
With a single tear crawling down his left cheek he placed a vow to all the
lawful citizens within Aabahran, the room in which Arther was formed will not
gather thier cries anymore.  The energies will be channeled into Arther
himself as he is the one who only grows stronger to fight the cause in which
is his very existance.  As long as there is crime within Aabahran, Lord Arther
will exist to fight and destroy it, even at this very moment Arther is
recruiting the mighty blades of the lands, they will watch over the cities
in his name and the way of Law.

#1092
-1 thoclya~
Of vague and mysterious origins, Thoclya rose to her current position of
power.  Rumored to have once been mortal, her physical form most resembles
the Duergar.  Regardless of her origins, it is widely accepted that Thoclya
rose to her station through pure force of will.  That will, born through her
own mental and spiritual powers, drives her influence throughout the realms.
She has the unique ability to commune power from her spiritual self to
amplify her physical self.  It is known that Thoclya is widely versed in
almost any topic, logical or philosophical.
 
 Although Thoclya constantly seeks to spread her influence throughout the
mortal world, it is not known whether she is an independent power, or if she
serves some greater force.  She is extremely expansionistic, although she is
also determined to keep herself shadowed in mystery and deception.  These
virtues have made her widely known as an ironic and inherently chaotic
Goddess.  Her tendancy to dabble in illusion and demonology have also made
her widely distrusted throughout the mortal realms.

WEAK  : Save vs Spell denied if saves are weak or non-existent
MEDIUM: Save vs Spell denied even if saves are of average amount

be further charged by re-casting the spell on the victim.

AMORPHOUS INFECTION  AMPLIFICATION: SPECIAL
Syntax: cast 'amorphous infection' victim
 
  Psionicists can pull amorphous creatures from other planes into our own, with 
only a tiny adjustment to the atoms in the air. In this case, an amorphous form 
of perhaps one centimeter by one centimeter will be pulled through, and it will 
instantly attack the victim. Each hour it remains on its host it will become more 
powerful, and deal a small bit more damage to them. When its host becomes close to 
death, it will attach itself to the nearest healthiest creature around. The only 
way for these shapeless beings to be extinguished is for someone to weaken with 
no-one near them.

*NOTE:  This spell normaly counts as WEAK amplification except against unnatural
or summoned begins including undead, demons and avatars.  Against such beings
the spell counts as STRONG.

Syntax: cast 'breach' <victim>
 
  When cast, this spell creates and contains a small fission reaction in 
a tunnel of about hair's width directed at the victim.  The force resulting 
from this directed containment is of such magnitude that it will overpower
and without chance to save remove all PROTECTIVE enchantments on the victim.

DISINTEGRATE
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <victim>
 
  Though many beneficial psionic spells depend on directed re-organization
of molecular structure, only this dreaded spell has ever been constructed
with the precise goal of using this ability against living things.  When
cast the Psionicsts for the shortest of instants removes cohesion between
molecules of its target lowering its hit points by 25% without a chance to
save.  If the victim lacks the fortitude to further resist the disintegration
they will potentially suffer massive damage to their constitution for an 
extended amount of time.

classes which use this system of spell casting.  In this system, a spell must be
first meditated upon before it can be cast by its user.  The commands "memorize"

PSIONICIST PSIONICISTS PSI PSIONICS
 
The history of the Psi can be traced to one diminutive Gnome by the
name of Snivelis Bentgear. Blessed with a remarkable intellect he
quickly ascended to the highest ranks of Invokers. He was renowned 
for his work on Mana charge theory and his lectures as Dean of the
Academy on the finer aspects of dispelling. Life for professor 
Bentgear was going as he had precisely planned, until the jealousy of 
colleagues lined the pockets of Syndicate. Snivelis was captured and
delivered to the deepest bowels of the Underdark. His Illithid captors 
exploited his open mind to enslave him into a simple verbal interpreter 
to the slave pens of the Hive and the army of Duergar they favored. 
 
After a time Snivelis began to dissect the manner in which he was 
manipulated. He could sense, if not see the waves of telepathy as they 
manipulated various areas of his brain. The nuance of a simple caress to 
the frontal lobe to invoke movement, the pin prick to the back for 
blinding pain.  Soon he realized how much potential there was for 
greater manipulation of not just others, but of the inanimate as well; the 
elements, the molecular structure of flesh and more. In a procedure 
only known to the great masters of the Psionicist guild, Snivelis 
sacrificed that part of him that held Mystic energy and in so doing 
strengthened his mind to heights no other in Aabaharn have ever 
known. Thus was Snivelis freed, and thus was the guild of Psionicist 
born.
 
To be accepted into the secret society of the Psionist one must be of 
superior intellect and unquestioned masters of their current magical 
craft. The Psi manipulates mana by drawing their power from their own 
mind rather than magical incantations from the Mystic energy around 
them. By doing so they are capable of the most powerful feats of 
magic ever seen. However, when performed such abilities are lost until 
properly meditated into memory once more. Meditation is the lifeblood 
of the Psi and their most coveted of rituals, a time when the mind is at 
peace and released from all existing spell maintenance. The particular 
abilities of the Psi are secretive and mysterious. Yet it is rumored that 
the  Psi can specialize their focus on melee, mental or destructive circles
of study.

WATCHER
 
For eons people of all races joined together in a common cause, a common
need, to form great cities to protect themselves from their neighbors and to
allow them to share the burden of lifes toils.  As more sprang and spread
the scars left by their building tore through the lands, making them
uninhabitable.  It was then that the god of nature appeared and told of what
was being done, and instructed those that dwelt in the cities to stop what
they had begun, and to restore what had been torn asunder.  But the people
were a vain and pompous lot, and had taken crowns and titles and made laws
that they felt justified their actions, even in the face of the words of a
god.  They did not heed his words, and so he left them with anger burning
inside him.
 
Then did the gods of death conspire against nature.
 
With the rebirth of the god Virigoth legions of undead rose from the
tombs and crypts to feed on the people of the lands, from a rift in time and
space came the Chaos Demons, reveling in the terror and suffering they
brought with them.  Then did the gods of death put their taint upon the
living, making them twisted, a perverted shadow of their former self.  They
were given eternal life, but at a price.  Called Vampires, they would
forever feed upon the blood of the people in the lands. 
 
And then the gods of light twisted their own.
 
They called their greatest followers to them and changed them, made them
a part of the Light itself, forsaking their spirits and bodies, they became
the nemesis of darkness, but they had paid a price in doing so, for they
were no longer what nature had made them to be. 
 
With each touch of their tainted forms the lands themselves cried out in
pain, deafening and torturing the god of nature.  And so it was that he
called to him his most loyal and hardy followers to combat those that would
tear down, those that would destroy, and those that are a taint upon the
lands, and in doing so created the Watchers.  Now they stalk the lands,
seeking those that rule and guard the cities, and those twisted by the gods
of light and darkness.

While it is said that nature is peaceful and nurturing, there are those
dedicated to its cause that are quite the opposite.  Deep in the heart of
the forests they gather, forever on guard against those that would intrude,
those that would harm, those that would destroy.  They are the sword, the
shield, and the fury of nature itself.  They are called Stalkers.  They
travel the lands searching for those tainted by gods and magic, seeking to
destroy them and rid the lands of their pestilence.
 
Since the gods changed and twisted mortals with their power, nature has
recoiled and rebelled at their touch, as it causes the lands to decay and
die.  The spirit of nature cries out in pain at their passing, sharing that
pain with those that are in tune with it.  Stalkers are dedicated to
eliminating all that is unnatural in the lands, and healing the scars caused
by their touch.  Be the creature of the Light or Darkness, it matters not,
Stalkers will hunt them relentlessly.  Due to this, only the bravest, most
dedicated followers will be allowed into their ranks, as they know no fear,
and will hunt even the most feared creatures in the lands.

-1 FERAL FERALS~
FERAL

In the year 368, a group of Miruvhorian refugees were forced to flee into
the Forsaken Lands.  These men and women, driven by the instinct of
survival, managed to make their home within those lands for some time. 
However, as time went on, their minds were tainted and their bodies ravaged
by the influence of Chaos in the corrupted land on which they lived. They 
began to crouch low as their bodies attuned to the wild and some grew claws 
with which  to defend themselves. Their senses were empowered tremendously 
even as fur covered their skin and their features grew more beastly then
human.  Fire, being once a tool necessary for survival, became their greatest 
fear.

The feral, as they have become known, emerged from the Forsaken Lands a
rugged and forever changed people.  They are extremely fast, strong and 
tough, and their need of survival has attuned their natural reflexes to the 
extreme. Being the product of corruption and tainted means, the natural world 
rejected them.  They in turn rejected the civilized world and the rules 
imposed upon it.  Living in an extremely harsh environment, their outlook on 
life is much the same.  Kindness and goodness are a foreign concept to their 
necessities of life.  The feral are truly the forsaken people of Aabahran.  

Feral can be the following classes: 
Warrior, Ranger, Thief, Ninja, Blademaster, Cleric, and Shaman

-1 Moleran~
Unlike many other gods, Moleran believes that one should always speak the 
truth. This is most likely the reason why mortals have been able to glean 
information about him in the most direct way possible: face-to-face 
conversations. From the many talks he has had with the "little ones" the 
following has become common knowledge: 
 
Moleran claims that he was once an angel in another plane of existence. 
This place, he says, was like no other. All that was sentient lived 
together in harmony. No blood was ever shed; no tear ever fell from one's 
eyes. Sorrow, terror, pain, anguish... Such words did exist. But only as 
abstract thoughts and meaningless words in books. Few truly knew and 
understood what they mean. 
 
This near-perfect existence came to an abrupt end. In ways that Moleran 
has not been able to ascertain, someone was able to open a direct portal 
between his world and that of the demon-kin. Countless monstrosities and 
numberless horrors poured through, intent on only one thing: destruction. 
Having never confronted this kind of situation, Moleran's superiors became 
convinced that one should fight fire with fire. Weapons were created, their 
forms based on the ones used by the demons. Strategies for slaughter were 
devised, all in the hope of turning back the demonic army. 
 
Suffice to say, the Rift triumphed. 
 
What happened to his fellow angels Moleran says he does not know. He 
spends much time searching for them, turning his gaze from one dimension to 
another, from one world to the next. All Moleran does know is that when the 
final battle ended in a cataclysmic explosion, he awoke here. In Aabahran. 
To his despair, Moleran saw that his old enemies have also invaded this 
land. Beings called "undead" exist here, an afront to all that is Life. Some 
of the mortals here even worship death and warfare, creating guilds and cabals 
to safeguard their dark ways. 
 
Yet, there is hope. There are those who seek a life free from violence. 
Innocent children who do not wish to grow up into bloodthirty warriors. 
Happy mothers who wish only the best for their families. Hard-working 
fathers who toil daily in the fields. These people wish peace, and little 
else. Moleran saw this, took pity, and decided to stay. Rising to the
heavens, he declared himself the Serenity Incarnate, Bringer of Peace.

QUICKLING

Quicklings are often mistaken for elven children due to their pointed ears
and small stature, but that doesn't stop most people from grabbing their
money sack in fear when they notice a Quickling's characteristic wrinkles
and outlandish clothing.  Quicklings are consumate thieves - though most get
quite offended if this is suggested.  Quickling simply have little grasp on
the concept of personal property, and are naturally good at picking locks
and pockets.  As such, they are often known to remark "Here, you must have
dropped this!"  Or "Ooops, this door seems stuck!"  Without realizing their
amazing natural skills.  

Unrelated, Quicklings are biologically immune to fear.  This is good; they
never run in panic.  This is bad; they never run in panic.  Many a Quickling
has stood its ground against a charging dragon, giant, or the like, thinking
"Gee, he looks mad...."  

A Quickling has a similar lifespan to a human, but at the onset of
adolescence, Quickling become infected with a condition which seems to force
them to travel the world.  Due to their boldness, there are few old
Quickling.  
 
Quicklings can be the following classes:
Warrior, Invoker, Battlemage, Bard

-1 goblin~
GOBLINS

Long ago, a group of Quicklings grew tired of the thievery and adolescense
of their brethern, so when an oppurtunity to form a colony arose, they
jumped at the chance to be amongst its foundation.  They had a singe goal-
to bring respect to the name of the Quickling, but they were a little too
lenient on where they'd settle.  

Their now home was more of an expiriment than a settlement.  They were asked
to live in houses built onto the inside of a volcano, in hopes that they
could capture the power they did not understand.  After centuries of living
in the volcano, it erupted...  Three out of every four Quickling was dead.. 
The others were burned beyond recognition.  They crawled, quite literally,
back to their Quickling brothers.  They found their old home...  But when
they arrived, their first party was taken into custody.  

The Quicklings, you see, did not recognize their brothers.  The Quicklings
were not a scholarly people...  So upon seeing these burnt creatures rise
out of the volcano, they believed them to be demons.  The Quickling,
however, sent emissaries to their only ally: the faeries, who could not come
to see the beasts and advised that the beasts probably were demons and
should be immediately executed.  And so it was.  The faeries eventually
realized their mistake...  At which point they tracked down the remaining
disfigured Quickling and used their magic to heal their wounds artificially,
but something went terribly wrong and the result was the most hideous thing
in existance: Goblins.  

Goblins can be the following classes:
Warrior, Invoker, Battlemage, Bard
