a chaosdemon~
A Chaosdemon stands here.
~
Before you stands a demonic aberration, stemmed directly from the ethereal
nexus. This is unlike a Chaos Demon, who lives in these planes. This demoic
minion lives only to kill and rend flesh, and seems much less sentient than
his Chaotic counterparts. Large claws to tear skin and huge, twisted muscles
are set in its body to snap bone. Fear grips you as you look into its eyeless
face, and it flicks its long, serpentine black tongue at you.

a striped kitten~
A small, cute kitten with stripes purrs here.
~
Soft and furry, a pink-nosed kitten glances innocently about with big, 
golden eyes, its tail sticking into the air with the tip slightly bent to 
the side.  Yellow and orange stripes coat its body from nose to tail to 
ever-so-delicate paws that are supported by supple, pink pads.
He looks far too intelligent to be your average cat.  As you look closer
into his eyes you find that there is some other spiritual force driving
this cat to another.  Other than that he is a cute kitty, who likes
warm milk and lots and lots of kitty snacks.

A featureless, faceless creature is here, caged and chained.

Grey skin is stretched tightly over a man-sized frame.  This odd
creature's head is devoid of feature, a blank sheet of flesh composing it's
face.  Thin arms are pulled to the side of it's body as thick iron chains,
covered in runes, bind it to the sides of the cage.  As you gaze at it, it
makes no movement or action to otherwise signal sentience.  How is this
creature a threat?  None can know.

an elven valykre~
An elven Valkyre stand here waiting for you to look at her.
~
A tall, lean elven lady stands before you, clad in a heavy suit of
brilliant gleaming armor kept in top condition.  Her arm, decorated on the
forearm with a silver blazing torch, tightly graps a gigantic mithril
polearm with an enchanted silvery blade that you can see your reflection in.
She has a lean, nimble figure as do most elves, her muscles are noticeably
larger and more definded than those of her fellow elves.  

Her face is simply beautiful, as if god had spent a great amount of time
perfecting every feature of it.  Her light tan skin complexion perfeclty
agrees with her light golden hair and deep blue eyes.  Her face is
practically perfect, without any unsightly scars or blemishes detract from
her appearance.  What is most captivating about her face though, is her
eyes.  Her large, dark blue irises are filled with a look of curiosity mixed
with intelligence, and seem full of vigor.  Her facial expression is calm
and contemplative, yet displays a sense of confidence.  Her body is relaxed,
and legs positioned in a natural fighting stance that would allow her to
move with the speed needed to fight and defend herself effectively.  Her
confidence and superior physical condition suggest she is indeed a heavily
trained veteran of the battlefield.

brandishes its fiery blade.

Psalm of  Righteousness.

Following is a long and involved holy scripture about the Order of 
Crusades divine right to carry forth its missions, and its origins.  
various bits of  high minded propaganda are intertwined with very
advanced combat techniques that would give any well trained warrior
edge in combat.  You gather that this psalm will not only increase the
sheer damage the warrior causes, but also allow keen aim and precision.

Psalm of  Divine Void.

Following is a long and involved holy scripture about the virtues of
meditation and benefits of clear and focused mind on resisting effects
of various spells and maladies.  Throughout the long psalm are woven 
techniques and chants that could easily be found in a secret manual
of a monk monastery.  It is obvious that when properly used the psalm
would bring great mental strength to the user.

Within are inscribed strange glyphs and runes that seem to portray
the effect of such meditation to further enhance the senses of a
person, and to better allow them to see with more clear sight and
vision than ever before. Intertwined within the glyphs are two
recurring runes, one for observing the moral traits of people, and
one for finding truth within what is ordinarily invisible.

This tight confined room, echoes voices from the heavens.  Any sound you
make is amplified a hundred times before is swirled back to nothing.  Upon
your ears, the sound of your name, rings over and over.  Upon listening to
it in a loud repetitive manner, you conclude the name you are known by is
not one you wish echoed throughout the land.  Pray to the gods an acceptable
name, and such shall be whispered throughout the lands forever.

`2Before a Mirror``~
`&READ ALL WHAT FOLLOWS:``
 
  You have been placed here because your description ("help description")
did not meet with approval of the Immortal that moved you here.  Before
you are able to play once again, you will have to compose a better one
keeping following rules in mind:
 
1)  `!YOUR DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE FORMATTED TO AT MOST 70 LETTERS PER LINE.``
Use word processor to write/format/spell check your description, then paste
it into the mud's description editor. ("help editor")
 
2)  `&Your description should be like a picture frozen in time.``
There should be no actions being performed, only descriptions of what
the character looks like, or looks like he is doing.
 
3)  `&You should NEVER force the looker to do, feel or think anything.``
The looker should make up their own minds about who you are, and what
you might be doing.
 
4)  `&The description should describe you, not your history.``
Concentrate on describing your characters stance, face, body, and their
equipment.  Not who they are, and where they came from.
 
5)  `&Do NOT say how powerful, fearful, or deadly you are.``
The description is not the place to "stroke your ego" by saying how
powerful you are and how fearful you look.  
 
6)  You may include descriptions of equipment that you would like your
character to wear (family crested shields, particular sword etc.) since
it is understood that the actual game equipment changes too often.
When you are done your description and it has been `!formatted`` and 
`!spell checked`` pray ONCE per approximately 10 minutes that you are 
done.

`8Role-Playing Room``~
From Shadowspawn,
 
If you see this room then it most likely means you did something we don't
approve of.  Word of advice, instead of giving bullshit excuses
or trying to talk back to the imms, shut up, listen, and most importantly
agree.  Because if you choose to ignore our warnings, don't expect to go
too far.

`8Slow, painful death``~
Yes, you have been sentenced to death. The Gods have found your actions
punishable by death, and so you sit in a fiery inferno, devoid of any
exit, to await your last mortal breath. If you believe you have been
wrongfully sent here to die, now would be a nice time to write the Gods
a scribe, and plead your case. But, chances are, you'll be dead long
 they before they read it. If you want a quick death, just say 'Death',
and the Executioner will see to it.
